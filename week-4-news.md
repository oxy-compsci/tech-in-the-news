Apple has launched ground surveys on the streets of London, Birmingham and Manchester to gather pedestrian data for its Apple Maps service using special backpacks.
Apple cars are not able to reach some parts of these cities because of how the cities are pedestrianizing areas to make it more appealing and reduce car usage.
The backpacks will feature cameras and other sensors for mapping data collection that cars can't reach and be able to show people what these cities look like in 3D view.
This surveying help with people's privacy as well because Apple won't have to track people for this information that they are getting from this survey.

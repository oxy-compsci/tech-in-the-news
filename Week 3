* [Apple finally kills the iPod touch, thus ending the iPod line for good](https://mashable.com/article/apple-discontinues-ipod-touch)

  This article talks about Apple's termination of touch feature of its popular product in the past, iPod. 
  In doing so, Apple has finally pulled the plug on the iPod product line, as the touchscreen-based variant,
  which was basically a cheap iPhone without the phone part, was the only one being manufactured before the
  announcement. Apple started selling iPods in 2001, and while the device may not have single-handedly killed 
  physical CD sales, it could certainly be seen as the face of the MP3 movement. While itâ€™s sad to see the iPod 
  line cross the rainbow bridge, I think this decision will propel Apple to succeed more in the future.

* [Techâ€™s latest IPOs are getting demolished, with Robinhood, Rivian, UiPath down over 70% from offer price](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/09/techs-latest-ipos-fall-with-robinhood-rivian-uipath-down-over-70percent.html)

  This article talks about the hammered tech stocks of companies that went through an IPO or direct listing, since the start
  of 2022. It explains that of 53 tech-related companies tracked that went public last year through an IPO, all but three are
  now trading below their offer price. Further, more than half have tumbled by at least fifty percent, including big companies 
  such as Coinbase and Robinhood. The article mentions the soaring inflation and concerns of rising interst rates
  that pushed investors out of the riskiest assets with the highest multiples as one of the possible explanations
  for this phenomenon. As someone who is transitioning into the tech industry, this article helped me open my eyes to 
  the current situations in the stock market for tech companies and be aware of the values of the stocks that these companies
  give out to their employees.

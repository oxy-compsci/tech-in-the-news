* [What the heck is UST and why is it causing crypto chaos?](https://mashable.com/article/ust-luna-what-is-happening)

  This article talks about the cryptocurrency prices falling and some of the reasons associated with it.
  It explains that the recent rapid decline is unusual, when the price suddenly dropped to $0.6 from $0.9.
  Further, it explains why this trend is bad because something like this would cause chaos in the U.S. and 
  the global economy, with prices of transportation suddenly increasing and causing other prices to grow 
  even more, ultimately making it hard or impossible for many people to purchase essential goods such as food.
  I think since Bitcoin's price is itself volatile and it's not doing well in the current macroeconomic climate, 
  these price declines will happen more often in the close future.

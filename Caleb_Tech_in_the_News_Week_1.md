[Alexa tells 10-year-old girl to touch live plug with penny](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59810383)

According to a BBC article, Amazon's Alexa told a 10-year old girl to "Plug in a phone charger about halfway into a wall outlet, then touch a penny to the exposed prongs." Of course the girl did not do the challenge, and the mother screamed in disapproval. This all came about after the girl and her family were playing a game where they asked Alexa for challenges to do. The first couple of challenges were completely normal and lighthearted, until Alexa presented the dangerous challenge that it found the web. Apparently, this challenge originates from a TikTok trend where kids would perform and record the dangerous stunt at school. Amazon has since fixed the bug.

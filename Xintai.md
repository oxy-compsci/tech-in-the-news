* [Facebook market cap falls below $600 billion — which could actually help it dodge new antitrust scrutiny] (https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/08/facebook-market-cap-under-600-billion-threshold-for-antitrust-bills.html)

Lauren Feiner's article touches on the recent events regarding the renamed 
company Meta and a newly released package of competition bills designed 
specifically to target big tech companies. These bills call for large tech 
companies such as Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft to stay below a market cap of 
$600 billion. Though these bills have not yet been passed into law, they could 
significantly impact Meta on top of the antitrust lawsuit under an already 
existing law from the Federal Trade Commission regarding the company’s alleged 
goal of maintain monopoly power through its acquisition of Instagram and 
WhatsApp. This call of a market cap by the senate is an attempt to control 
and stifle rapidly growing big tech companies.

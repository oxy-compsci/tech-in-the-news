* [49ers Blitzed by Ransomware](https://www.technewsworld.com/story/49ers-blitzed-by-ransomware-87416.html)

BlackByte ransomware gang attack the San Francisco 49er's computer systems
using ransomware that leaked the team's financial data. 
The FBI says that no ransom demands were made public and didn't reveal
how much data was stolen and they think that it would be a part of a 
"double-extortion" scheme to get more money out of the 49ers.
BlackByte is thought of being a gang of hackers that tried to gain notoriety
after the Super Bowl occurred and shows how leaking financial data was unusual 
for ransomware attacks.
Even with these ransomware groups becoming more professional and organized,
there might be more ways of law enforcement to defeat and subdue them.

[China Plans Reprieve for Tech Giants, Including Delaying New Rules, as Economy Slows](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-plans-reprieve-for-tech-giants-including-delaying-new-rules-as-economy-slows-11651230087)

China has had regulators of the internet that limit the amount of time young people spend on certain mobile apps such as TikTok and Twitter. They have recently been planning to expand to other tech companies to ensure they are aligned with the government’s policies, which would also help China economically by promoting more jobs. This shows how technology creates an intersection of political, economic, and social issues that impact people’s daily lives. In this case, China’s government will gain more power the more they invest in tech companies and therefore has more control over how Chinese citizens can utilize their technology.


[Google makes $100,000 worth of tech training free to every US business](https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-makes-100000-worth-tech-training-free-every-us-business-2022-05-02/)

Google has made a profit of over $100,000 with their online courses in tech skills such as data analytics, design, etc. Google’s program, Google’s Career Certificates, that launched in 2018 has expanded significantly thanks to this profit. I believe this signifies an increasing prosperity in the tech industry. Not only that, but it paves a new way for learning and gaining new skills and education in tech that would have otherwise only been accessible through school.

[Tech Companies Are Not Ready for a Post-Roe Era](https://www.wired.com/story/tech-companies-not-ready-post-roe-era/)

With the recent criminalization of abortion, tech companies wound up being in the center of discussion of abortion access and reproductive rights. These companies have largely been synonymous with a young and liberal workforce, and will suddenly be forced to take a stand when it comes to protecting their employees’ rights to access abortion while navigating through Republican legislators seeking political payback against any company that challenges them on conservative social policies. This is just another example of how technology has become so integrated into our lives, especially for those whose careers are in technology. It is not just from the perspective of people as users of technology but also the people that work and contribute to these companies that these tech companies face challenging ethical issues for.

[Spotify becomes first music streamer to launch on Roblox](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/03/spotify-becomes-first-music-streamer-to-launch-on-roblox/)

Spotify will become the first music streaming service to collaborate with Roblox in their launch of “Spotify Island”. It will include interactive quests for players to unlock exclusive content and buy artist merchandise as well as a musical play box in the top right corner of the world, which will feature a soundtrack powered by Soundtrap, which can be played or paused, or players can skip tracks. Although these are two big companies with completely different functions, this displays just how much range technology has and so many aspects of social life and entertainment that still have potential to keep expanding. With this collaboration, there will also definitely be an expansion in terms of audience for both the companies, also showing how tech can introduce new social aspects to people.

[Best Buy branches into skincare products, as technology moves into new markets](https://www.startribune.com/best-buy-branches-into-skincare-products-as-technology-moves-into-new-markets/600171051/)

Best Buy has begun to invest into more product categories such as health, e-transportation and outdoor living as smart investments. They now have products ranging from skincare to fitness to virtual reality and are focused on supporting consumers in their care-at-home journey. We can see how technology is constantly changing and expanding especially in the technology we use to take care of daily tasks. Although it’s not necessarily a complete transformation, technology is slowly making its way into more and more aspects of our lives.

[NFTs in Video Games Bring Laundered Money and Angry Players](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/05/07/nfts-gaming-laundering-emissions/)

Some game publishers have been seeing NFTs as an opportunity to further build out their in-game marketplaces because of a long-term shift toward treating video games as a service, rather than as a discrete product purchased a single time. The main reason these game publishers have been wanting to use NFTs and the “games as a service” approach is because it will likely get more engagement in their games by keeping players in the game longer than traditional games. As new forms of technology appear, especially in recent years, the tech and entertainment industries have been transforming as well, becoming completely different from what they were just a few years ago. With the increasing popularity of jobs in technology, we can also see from the perspective of people like game publishers how they utilize these advances to gain their own profit as well.


[After Covid-era boom, newly public tech stocks hit first major hurdles](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/07/after-covid-era-boom-newly-public-tech-stocks-hit-first-major-hurdles.html)

When the COVID-19 pandemic had hit and people were put in quarantine, tech companies experienced a major boom but are now facing the worst six months of their lives as publicly traded companies. Tech companies are especially vulnerable during an economic downturn, and this has caused some people to observe the overall economic instability in tech from recent years. The pandemic was an unforeseen circumstance that caused a much more heavy reliance on technology than usual, despite the fact that technology is constantly integrating itself into new aspects of our lives. Although we are still using a lot of technology, it makes sense for the sudden boom for tech companies to burn out once people start getting out of the restrictive circumstances of the pandemic.

[Governments only: The public doesn't get a say in the internet's future](https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/3479885-governments-only-the-public-doesnt-get-a-say-in-the-internets-future/)

The Biden administration has led 60 countries in signing a Declaration for the future of the Internet which states the goal of advancing a positive vision for the internet in the 21st century, one grounded in the democratic values of openness, inclusion and human rights. However, the European Union has given this backlash with their recent adoption of sweeping digital rules. The fact that these declarations and rules are being created shows the increasing significance of the Internet. Since the Internet has become such a large platform, it is likely for more and more policies and rules to regulate it as politics becomes more influential in it.


[SoftBank reports record $27.5 billion loss on crashing tech stocks](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/12/investing/softbank-vision-fund-earnings-fy2021-intl-hnk/index.html)

Japanese company SoftBank's mega tech funds lost more than $27 billion in the last fiscal year, their worst performance on record. Since the start of the year, their shares with other companies have slumped, dropping over 60%. We are now witnessing the economic downturn for tech companies after the pandemic. Despite how natural it has seemed for technology to be constantly growing, both in the industry and our daily lives, this economic inflation will soon turn to a recession making our futures with technology more uncertain.

Chipotle is testing a robot named "Chippy" that will be used in a restaurant in Southern California later this year to make chips.
It uses artificial intelligence to cook and season Chipotle's core tortilla chip recipe. 
CEO Mike Bell also says that Chippy uses the same tech that is used in another cooking robot with it being the same arm and a similar frame.
Despite a robot potential taking another person's job, Chipotle claims they are looking for ways to make its jobs more consistent and efficient since frying chips can make it harder for workers that are busy.

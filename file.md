This article is about a new drive system for flapping wing autonomous robots that has been developed by a University of Bristol team, using a new method of electromechanical zipping that does away with the need for conventional motors and gears. This advance can pave the way for micro flying robots for environmental monitoring, search and rescue, and deployment in hazardous environments. https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/02/220202143053.htm

* [Instagram jumps on the NFT bandwagon as the wheels spin off](https://mashable.com/article/meta-instagram-nfts)

  This article talks Instagram joining the NFT market that would let users connect digital wallets to their Instagram accounts and share verified NFTs.
  The article explains that Instagrm is beginning to test digital collectibles with a handful of U.S. creators and collectors who will be able to share 
  NFTs on Instagram that they have created or bought. Further, Instagram will be initially supporting NFTs on the Ethereum and Polygon blockchains, 
  and support Flow and Solana, both Crypto ecosystems, soon. I think Instagram's decision to hop into the NFT market
  along with others will allow people to increase the usage of Instagram, as they share their digital collectibles with others.

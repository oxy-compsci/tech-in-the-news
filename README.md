* [A 1-mile stretch of road is being built in Detroit that can charge electric cars as they drive -- if owners install a special receiver](https://www.businessinsider.com/public-road-detroit-to-charge-electric-cars-as-they-drive-2022-2?utm_source=reddit.com)
	Tech startup Electreon Wireless is working with Ford and DTE to build an electrified road that charges cars through inductive charging.
	Through a special receiver that costs about $3,000 to $4,000 to install, cars can be charged while driving or stopped.
	The hope is that wireless charging will aid in mass EV adoption by easing concerns related to driving range. 
	Similarly, researchers at Cornell have been working on wireless charging using electric fields instead of the magnetic ones that Electreon uses, a change that might make the process cheaper and more efficient.

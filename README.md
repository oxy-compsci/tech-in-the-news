* [Engineers develop a 'magnetic tentacle robot' to pass into the narrow tubes of the lung](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/03/220321205411.htm)

  In the lungs, there are many small bronchial tubes that can be hard to reach. Engineers have made a prototype of a robot that can reach these tubes and take tissue samples or deliver cancer therapy. Researchers at the University of Leeds have created a magnetic tentacle robot. It could be used to help with endoscopic and catheter operations, which involve inserting a small tube into the body. This week, researchers published their findings in the journal Soft Robotics. A robot that can navigate the bronchial tree has been developed by researchers at the University of Leeds. Magnetic tentacle robots are tiny, flexible, and controlled. Outside of the patient, autonomous robotic arms would guide the gadget into position.This could be an evolutionary change for the medical industry. If we put this technology in the simplest way, it means that this technology could potentianlly save more people's lives and reduce their pain. In the long term impact, this magnetic tentacle robot has a greater potentinal in treating other diseases such a blood vessels or urine track disease. in conclusion, the invetion of  magnetic tentacle robot is a potential solution for many difficult medical operation and could impact many people and thier families.

* [Pandemic mood: Much worse than a bad Monday](https://news.mit.edu/2022/pandemic-mood-social-media-0317)

  This essay examines the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on global emotions via social media.MIT researchers look at millions of social media posts from around the world. After the pandemic takes hold in early 2020, there will be a significant drop in favorable public sentiment. Following that, there was a gradual, halting return to pre-pandemic state. The findings were published today in the journal Nature Human Behaviour. Australia, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Colombia experienced the greatest declines in sentiment. Bahrain, Botswana, Greece, Oman, and Tunisia were the countries least hit by the pandemic. Lockdown policies did not appear to have a significant impact on popular sentiment. Some countries required up to 29 days to recover half of the dip in public opinion that occurred during a lockdown. Researchers discovered that 18% of countries did not recover to their pre-lockdown, pre-surgical attitude levels. In my opinion, this article shows how social media influence the society during the pendamic, while many people is required to quareteen themselves if they get caught by covid, the lost of freedom enforeces a trumendous amount of mental stress on these people. Social media become one of the major technology for these people to entertain themselves during those times. however, there are downsides to it, the social media became one of the major communication tool around the world, meaning people could potentinally receive a large amount of negative information about the pandemic , causing them additional stress.

* [Google is using AI to better detect searches from people in crisis](https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/30/23001468/google-search-ai-mum-personal-crisis-information)

  Google wants to do more to help people get the information they need, and it claims that new AI approaches that better comprehend the complexity of language are assisting individuals crisist. Google's search engine is using machine learning. MUM will be able to detect search queries relating to severe personal situations that previous techniques were unable to detect. MUM may respond to inquiries such as "most prevalent methods of suicide completion" and "Sydney suicide hot locations." According to the company, it has "reduced unanticipated stunning results" by 30% year on year. Google does not reveal how many "startling results" its consumers encounter on a daily basis. In my opinion, Google using Ai to better detect searches ffrom people in crisis can help thouse people in several ways and present a good impact othe society. As we know, that when internet people ecounters crisis, their first reactionis either ask thier friends, parents, or search online In additon to the recent increase in depression, google using AI may help the user to realize thier issues and provide better solution faster.

* [Goodle Bans Apps With Hidden Data-Harvesting Software](https://www.wsj.com/articles/apps-with-hidden-data-harvesting-software-are-banned-by-google-11649261181)

  Google recently pulled a number of apps from its library after discovering they all contained code that was harvesting data. The data harvesting code was made by a Panamanian company and was found in prayer apps to highway speed trap detecting apps. Some companies were paid to include this code into their apps, however, this was uncovered by a company owned by two men called AppCensus which focuses on the privacy and security of various apps. Companies like AppCensus are very helpful in this time of focus on privacy and security, and the fact that companies are being paid to incorporate such invasive code into their apps needs to be addressed. It is the duty of the creator to put the user first, but the commodity of data can create a moral dilemma in the development.

* [Researchers Use Imitation to Teach a Robot How to Peel a Banana](https://apple.news/AXvhCmI93TbuGx9k6nrLKIA)

  As the article explains a deep imitation learning method is used to teach a robot to peel a banana. Handling delicate objects such as a banana and performing intricate tasks is not as simple as it may seem. The Researchers at Systems and Informatics Laboratory used goal-conditioned dual actions deep imitation learning, which essentially used human demonstrations to teach the robot. So basically there was a point where the research team had to peel hundreds of bananas over and over again to create the learning data set. Robots having the ability to perform these intricate tasks can be used to help out during times of labor shortages.

* [US Disrupts 'Cyclops Blink' Botnet by Hacking Infected Devices](https://apple.news/AFU7z3KTsTkmRvLCcynANfg)

  The United States Justice Department has secured the approval to remotely remove the malware from some of the infected devices in the Botnet in an attempt to take down the Cyclops Blink. The US has concluded that Russian Military Intelligence is responsible for creating the Botnet as a way to spy on company websites. Once a device is infected by the Cyclops Blink the hacker has the ability to remotely upload and download files to and from the device. It is important that is Botnet is taken care of, it is a very invasive virus that has the ability to take and download any material, and along with that it can change firewall rules to block future access.

* [Twitter's latest change shows how link rot is ruining the internet](https://apple.news/Ao-pK_sduTeaeXNJV5hc5-A)

  Twitter has recently tested an edit funtion that now deletes embeded tweets, so when a tweet is deleted entirely from twitter every reference of the tweet is now also deleted. Some believe this will be the first of many changes now that Elon Musk purchased more than 9% of the company. Elon Musk is said to be a "free speech absolutist" so that may play a part into the potential changes coming to twitter. This function can be very useful for users who may have had something posted without their consent, or simply someone just changed their mind on a thought, this is a useful change to help protect the user.

* [How Europe has expanded its bid to disrupt Big Tech](https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/25/how-europe-has-expanded-its-bid-to-disrupt-big-tech/)

  Recently, the European Union (EU) has decided on a reform of digital competition rules, enforcing "dos and don'ts" for many powerful tech giants with fines and other penalities if they don't meet them accordingly. Many antitrusts cases surrounding Amazon, Google, and Apple have occurred in European countries, and have slowly decreased EU's trust in these companies. Not only will these new rules combat the abuse, but they believe it will foster "innovation, growth, and competitiveness". So far, some rules for the DMAs (Digital Market Acts) are going to occur around messaging, essentially asking the user if they're okay with sharing their messages across multiple platforms and/or countries. From the perspective of a user, this is a massive leap in taking power away from the tech giants who have extreme amounts of data, and abuse their power to gather information on people (like myself) to make more revenue; I've even heard rumors of Apple phones listening to your conversations. Especially with issues of data privacy (and data being breached) in companies such as Facebook, it makes far more sense to ask the user beforehand as a transfer of power from the tech giant to the user in terms of data. Not only does this provide transparency and equality, but the added innovation (i.e. generating algorithms that require less data) may come as a side bonus (as stated in the article).

* [Twitter is working on an edit button for real](https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/05/twitter-edit-button-twitter-blue/)

  In recent news, Twitter has decided, despite it being "low on its priority list", to create an edit button for tweets. Creating the edit button was difficult as there were strong opinions for and against it, and Twitter chose to stay neutral for a long time (until around last year where they started thinking about it). The article notes that Twitter "power users" have asked for years for an edit button, while others have been worried about the chances of further misinformation and harassment being propagated utilizing this feature. The edit button, in my eyes, is a double-edge sword. While the edit button is very useful for users to correct themselves and avoid the spread of misinformation, it also works in the opposite direction where a user could gain traction on a tweet and edit it later with propaganda. Therefore, the edit button grants new power to Twitter user in choosing what information they want to transmit to the world for both the good and bad. To finalize, there's one other big issue I see (with other sites like Reddit), where viewing the edit history of a comment is difficult (or not possible); I'd hope that twitter would allow anyone to see a tweet's edit history (to further help with misinformation).

* [Lapsus$: Oxford teen accused of being multi-millionaire cyber-criminal](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60864283)

  A 16-year-old from Oxford has been accused of being one of the leaders of cyber-crime gang Lapsus$. The teenager, who is alleged to have amassed a $14m fortune from hacking, has been named by rival hackers and researchers. Under his online moniker "White" or "Breachbase" the teenager, who has autism, is said to be behind the prolific Lapsus$ hacker crew, which is believed to be based in South America. The Lapsus$ cyber-extortion group has gained notoriety in a short space of time thanks to its high-profile targets and active presence on the messaging app Telegram. The last message was posted on the channel on Wednesday, with the group saying: "A few of our members has a vacation until 30/3/2022. This is truly amazing, a prime example of how the progression of the abilities amassed by normal day people can lead to increased power struggles in a more online future society. The fact that there has multiple cases throughout history where teenagers have been able to disrupt the cyberspace with relative ease is a concern which should be better addressed in order to prevent a plausible cyber Armageddon.

* [Pro-Russia Sentiment on Indian Twitter Draws Scrutiny](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/technology/twitter-russia-india.html)

  This article by Kate Conger and Suhasini Raj describes how in the days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, thousands of Twitter accounts shared messages of support for Vladimir. While some of the accounts said they were based in Nigeria and South Africa, the majority of those with a declared location on Twitter claimed to be from India and targeted their messages to other Indian users, researchers said. The prevalence of accounts claiming to be from Indian users indicates that India's social media landscape has become an important destination in the effort to influence public opinion of the war in Ukraine. Users who said they were from India made up nearly 11 percent of the hashtag trend in the two weeks after the invasion. The death of an Indian student in the fighting in Ukraine this month brought into focus India's challenge of evacuating nearly 20,000 of its citizens who were in the country when Russia's invasion began. But some of the accounts in India most likely belonged to real people. This article demonstrates how modern media today is used formulate and shepherd our political and critical thinking within society. It has been abused throughout history, yet most people do not care to notice. Those who do recognize this pattern of manufactured mass-thinking through society, such as Noam Chomsky, as set aside or largely ignored. This problem will be persistent, and this article is a prime example of how even though people notice a government’s attempts to influence normal peoples’ thoughts and logic, most people will still fail to notice the more minute details of propaganda available within everyday life.

* [Axie Infinity's Ronin Network Hacked to the Tune of $600 Million](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/crypto/axie-infinitys-ronin-network-hacked-to-the-tune-of-600-million/)

  Recently, a group of hackers made a total of $600 million in cryptocurrency after an attack they conducted on the Ronin network, which supports Axie Infinity. Axie Infinity is a popular video game that runs on the Ronin Network, which connects the video game and blockchains to transfer cryptocurrency in and out of the game. The Axie Infinity game works as a game where the players breed digital monsters that essentially work as an NFT. Players are able to earn cryptocurrency through playing the game, and then are able to transfer those earnings out of the game and into the blockchain. The hacking shows a big problem with Ronin network as there are billions of dollars being circulated through it. There is going to need to be a change to the network to ensure a better security of people's money and cryptocurrency in both the blockchain and within the game. I feel that this shows the danger of putting money into cryptocurrency. The security of the server's that the currency circulates through might not be completely secure and this hacking is an example of that. I think that it important to possibly consider the risks of losing your money if there is a hacking. It might be smarter to wait until these young crypto companies have a stronger security system.

* [Robot made of magnetic slime could grab objects inside your body](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2314395-robot-made-of-magnetic-slime-could-grab-objects-inside-your-body/)

  This article touches on the topic of a robotic slime that can be controlled to move through narrow passageways. The slime is able to grab objects the need to be retrieved. The big potential use of a robot like this is that it can be used inside the human body to retrieve objects that were not meant to swallowed or even in other parts of the body to perform surgeries. This robot is able to do two different tasks where most robots could only ever do one of the two. In my opinion, this is a bright sign for the future in medical technology because the robot can be used to save countless lives if the technology gets developed enough to actually get used in operations on people. I feel like there is still a lot of progress that needs to be made because one thing to worry about is that the slime has a surface that is not toxic to humans, but there is a component to the robot that is toxic and could cause more harm to humans if it were to find its way out of the slime outside. I do like the potential other uses the robot has such as an object that is able to navigate through tight circuitry to fix a busted wire.

* [Museums Are Cashing In on NFTs](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/25/arts/design/museums-nfts.html)

  Due to pandemic-related lockdowns and reprioritized government spending have put the world’s public museums under financial pressure.
  To raise fund, museums are turning to nonfungible tokens (NFTs) of art reproductions.
  In Unit London, an art dealership in London, there was an elaborately framed LED screen with a digital replica of Leonardo da Vinci’s “Portrait of a Musician” glowing on their gallery wall.
  That piece was part of the ["Eternalizing Art History"](https://unitlondon.com/whats-on/98-eternalising-art-history-from-da-vinci-to-modigliani/) exhibition at Unit London, an attempt by cash-poor museums to generate money by selling NFTs.
  Another notable example, the State Hermitage Museum, in St. Petersburg, Russia, which last September held an [auction of NFT replicas](https://cointelegraph.com/news/russian-state-hermitage-raises-440k-via-binance-nft-auction) of five of its best-known paintings that raised $444,000.
  However, museums are hesitant to sell NFTs because many of them rely on public opinion and the environmental concerns around NFTs are quite deterring.
  According to one estimate, the computing power required to mint one NFT generates the same amount of greenhouse gas as a 500-mile journey in a gasoline-powered car.
  I find this as an interesting, and unexpected, move from museums.
  I never would have concieved this as an option, but that may be due to the fact I have no interest in NFTs.
  Sharing the concern for the environemental impact of NFTs, I don't think that this is a good alternative for museums, as least with energy cost that is currently required to create an NFT.
  NFTs are volatile and I don't think museums should have to rely on them in order to sustain themselves.
  With that said, I am in support of digital exhibitions.
  Unlike physical ones, I think that it is easier to turn a set of pieces into an experience, accompanied by audio, visuals, and context around the pieces, such as the [online exhibition on arpilleras](https://molaa.org/arte-mujer-memoria-exhibition) by the Musuem of Latin American Art in Los Angeles.

* [A New City, Built Upon Data, Takes Shape in South Korea](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/28/technology/eco-delta-smart-village-busan-south-korea.html)

  In Busan, South Korea, 54 volunteers are part of a five year study in the Eco Delta Smart Village.
  At the end of the development, "the Eco Delta Smart City development will total 30,000 homes across 11.8 square kilometers, or 4.5 square miles, of coastal wetlands, in the Nakdong River delta, at a cost of about 6.6 trillion Korean won, or about $5.6 billion."
  Unlike in other places, the attempt here is to build a smart city from scratch.
  The current residents, the 54 volunteers, live there rent free, only having to pay for electricity and water, in exchange for there data, to be studied by "developers, appliance manufacturers, the government and health care experts."
  The goal is to be as sustainable as possible by watering green spaces with recylcled water and powering the village with hydroelectic and solar power.
  I find the idea interesting but have reservations about the scalability of this idea.
  Sustainability in urban areas is incredibly important and the methods they chose are good ones, however, the surrounding area is still being converted from wetlands to urban developments.
  With the fact that this is a model for creating more sustainable, technology-heavy cities in the future, I think about the cost associated with living in a smart home.
  How financially accessible will these be for people?
  Will is cause a geographic stratification of people with enough money to live in a smart city and those who must remain, or leave to, a traditional one?
  Also, it seems that this city is influenced by the day-to-day patterns of its residents but how does that work when you have a large city with a multitude of different routines?
  This concept is fascinating, but I maintain an amount of skepticism.

* [Hugs to Boring: The Tech That Holds Us Up](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/31/technology/hugs-to-boring.html)

  It's easy to forget the technologies that are no longer new but core to how our daily lives run.
  The week this article came out HP, a company that sells printers and computers, aquired Poly, a company that sells office audio equipment.
  These things aren't as flashy as the new technologies coming out of Silicon Valley but are integral for companies to run.
  People are very unlikely to be familiar with all the technologies intertwined in their life, such as the server that streams their movie from Netflix, the [Epic](https://www.epic.com/) software that holds their healthcare records, or the software that processes their paychecks.
  However, much of this important technology is outdated but the dullness of this technology limits interest in making it better despite the fact that it will outlast many of the new startups (e.g. food delivery services).
  I found topic of this article quite interesting because I hadn't thought about the legacy technologies that help to run our daily lives in quite some time.
  There is little to know glamour in the "regular" technologies but I feel that they are the areas where the most investments should be made.
  In recent years, California residents may have noticed the [redesigned DMV website](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/news-and-media/dmv-launches-redesigned-website/) which now has many more services and resources.
  Now this website is not without its faults but having working and secure technology for people to submit and manage applications, locate resources and documents, schedule appointments, etc. is incredibly important.
  Automating the things that can be automated is likely to make the lives of the users and DMV employees much easier, so I feel that these kinds of technologies should be valued more.

* [Google Tests Catching Heart, Eye Issues From Smartphone Sensors](https://www.usnews.com/news/technology/articles/2022-03-24/google-tests-catching-heart-eye-issues-from-smartphone-sensors)

  Google has plans to use smartphones to capture heart sounds and eye images in order to help users see their risks for potential health issues. For example, by listening to heartbeats and murmurs, the smartphone could potentially detect heart valve disorders. I have mixed feelings about this. Assuming there will be no to little monetary cost to users who make use of these services, this would help make healthcare accessible to a wide range of people including people located far from medical facilities and also people with lower incomes. However, since the service measures for elevated risk and does not provide a confirmed diagnosis, it could potentially cause unnecessary worry among its users when they are falsely told they may have a health condition.

* [Blockchains Have a ‘Bridge’ Problem, and Hackers Know It](https://www.wired.com/story/blockchain-network-bridge-hacks/)

  This article highlights the issue of hacker attacks against Blockchain bridges. A recent attack happened against Ronin Network, a blockchain transaction
  platform, that saw $540 million worth of cryptocurrency stolen. Related attacks happened in early 2022 with attackers stealing millions from other blockchain bridges,
  such as from Quibit Bridge and Wormhole bridge. Experts highlight that part of the hacker's success stems from poor security practice and monitoring of these blockchain bridges,
  which is what happened with Ronin when they were not aware of their security compromise on March 23 before the actual attack. Though I am not a blockchain enthusiast,
  it's clear that blockchain technology will continue to grow if people and entities are willing to put millions of dollars in digital currency in the hands of these blockchain platforms.
  However, I believe these hacker attacks should be seen as something to expect, since these blockchain bridges do keep storage of cryptocurrency, much like a reserve currency, making them
  digital banks. As such, there should be standardized security protocols for these platforms to perform and follow, since preparation provides a good measure to better withstand these attacks.
  Nonetheless, being proactive in the security of blockchain technology will better serve the people and companies that choose to invest in digital currency as the relationship between finance
  and technology continues to evolve.

* [The 3G shutdown will affect everyday devices you probably own](https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/tech/3g-network-shut-down/index.html)

  The shutdown of the 3G network will affect more than just old smartphones. Since 4G and 5G networks are better than 3G many companies are switching over and this means alot of systems that use 3G will not work anymore. Although companies can reach out to their customers to let them know about the change, there can still be people who won't realize the change and will be left exposed to potential threats. This can become dangerous for people with security systems that will act as if they are fine but will in reality not be connected to the security companies' central service. Hopefully companies will learn and become better at communicating to their customers the possibility of this happening in the future when the next generation of networks comes out.

* [Meta says it's shut down a pro-Russian disinformation network, warns of a social media hacking operation](https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/28/tech/meta-russia-ukraine-disinformation-network/index.html)

  Meta has been taking down accounts that have ties to misleading information about Ukraine posted by Russian accounts. These accounts have been making posts and making claims that would lead people to think that discredit Ukraine as a false state. I think this is an improvement from Russia's involvement in the US presidential elections of 2016. It is also important that these types of accounts get taken down sooner than later, before they gain a larger audience and have a larger effect. I do think Facebook could do more in teaching its users about misinformation and how to spot it.

* [Ralph Lauren CEO says metaverse is way to tap into younger generation of shoppers](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/17/ralph-lauren-ceo-says-metaverse-is-way-to-tap-into-younger-shoppers.html)

  The CEO of Ralph Lauren said that selling virtual clothing items on the metaverse would be a good way to gain the attention of the younger generations. Other companies like Nike and Walmart have already started buying companies and filing patents to get into virtual retail. I think this will be a smart move on the companies side but only if they are able to also rebrand their clothing to fit the younger generations they are trying to connect with. People know of Ralph Lauren but their clothing is just aimed towards older people, if they want to succeed with younger generations they have to do some redesigning. Also when I think of virtual fashion, I think of things that can't physically be made in the real world, so I think Ralph Lauren would have to branch out. Overall, I don't know if bigger clothing companies will be as successful because there are so many young designers that will make more creative clothing and not have to worry about the cost of production that would be an obstacle in the real world.

* [Yelp expands restaurant health ratings in partnership with food tech startup Hazel Analytics](https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/31/yelp-restaurant-health-ratings-in-partnership-with-food-tech-startup-hazel-analytics/)

  Yelp is partnering with Hazel analytics to provide users with health ratings for restaurants. This provides health information for over 700,000 restaurants on Yelp. I think this is a great addition to the yelp app and something I will definitely use in the future. I also think this speaks to the increased importance we as a society are now putting on public health because of the pandemic. Keeping things clean is something every restaurant, big and small, can do so having a large company that directly influences people's choice of restaurants display this type of information will definitely push all restaurants to do better.

* [Astronaut Helmets Straight out of Sci-Fi Could Decipher Our Brains in Microgravity](https://www.cnet.com/science/space/astronaut-helmets-straight-out-of-sci-fi-could-decipher-our-brains-in-microgravity/)

  Israeli neuroscience startup Brain.space is going to capture if brains adapt to a new homeostasis while in space by measuring the brain activity of 4 astronauts sent to space. This data, which will be available to everyone, will help scientists determine what the effects of microgravity are on the human brain. One of the things that caught my eye about this was the data collected would be accessible to people all around the world so that they could conduct their own research on it. Also, the people at Brain.space made this brain activity collecting helmet with the hope of people on earth using it as well so that it would become easier to collect information about the brain for people who want to build products for the brain. They mention they imagine it being used for fitness apps and accessories, like the apple watch, but I question the necessity of brain information to provide normal people with workout routines or their workout data.

* [The metaverse may bring new cyber risks. Here's what companies can do](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/23/the-metaverse-may-bring-new-cyber-risks-heres-what-firms-can-do.html)

  With the transition of people making business calls or sharing other important information in the metaverse, there is the growing concern of people pretending to be someone else or creating a deep fake. The article goes into different suggestions for how untrustworthy people could be singled out but that the main thing will be to train people to not fall victim to these attacks. Overall, some good points are made but like it was also mentioned in the article, there needs to be more work done in building a secure base for people to be in the metaverse or else they will lose trust in it. I think that people who work on metaverse projects should look back at the faults from the normal web and try to improve on them. One major concern is privacy and dealing with the new information that can be collected from people, like our eye movements and voice.

* [Another Arrest and Jail Time Due to a Bad Facial Recognition Match](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/29/technology/facial-recognition-misidentify-jail.html)

  A New Jersey man was accused of shoplifting and trying to hit an officer with a car and he is
  now the third known Black man to be wrongfully arrested because of faulty facial recognition
  software. In 2019, a national study of over 100 facial recognition algorithms found that they did
  not work as well on Black and Asian faces. Facial recognition works by reading the geometry of
  a subject’s face, using key factors such as the distance between the eyes and the distance
  between the chin and forehead. The facial signature is then compared to a database of known
  faces. However, if the technology is not perfected, it should not be used because it
  disproportionately harms the Black community. One way to increase the accuracy of facial
  recognition is by using the identification algorithm to match people to clear, static images such
  as a passport photo or a mugshot.

* [Google Docs will start nudging some users to write less dumbly](https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/1/23005972/google-docs-assisting-writing-active-voice-concise-inclusive-language-inappropriate-words)

  Google recently began trialing a feature that would suggest ways to improve the
  quality of writing of the user, similar to the way that applications such as
  Grammarly already do. Although this feature already exists in other applications,
  there has been major pushback against this feature becoming available to free
  users as many believe that making such a feature easily accessible will decrease
  the writing ability of the general population. Personally, I kind of agree with
  this stance; I think that such tools do have the possibility of decreasing the
  amount of work that we have to do as individuals. However, while the current
  implementation might not be the best, I could see a way where Google or some
  other company could provide explanation for the suggestion, which can help
  improve the writing ability of users, and similar functionality could be added
  to other apps that make tasks easier

* ['No-Code' Brings the Power of A.I. to the Masses](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/15/technology/ai-no-code.html)

  Sean Cusack is a Software Engineer at Microsoft who used Microsoft's [Lobe.AI](https://www.lobe.ai/) to train a computer-vision system to recognize non-bee insects in his beehive.
  This process involved no coding and consisted of him dragging and dropping images of his bees to train the model.
  There is a growing movement of "No Code" that makes complex computer system accessible to the public.
  Craig Wisneski, co-founder of [Akkio](https://www.akkio.com/), created his starup to allow anyone to make prediction using data.
  Similarly, [Juji](https://juji.io/), founded by Michelle Zhou, makes creating AI chatbots "as easy as creating a PowerPoint presentation."
  I like the idea of bringing these technologies to the public because as it grows to more people, the limits get pushed as new ideas and needs arise.
  With that said, I find an area of concern to be the fact that many of the popular algorithms, and the datasets used to train them, are biased in their representation of the public.
  By bringing these tools into the hands of the public, we might be giving more power to groups that benefit from current structures of power, further disadvantaging marginalized groups.
  If these technologies are going to be able to be used by everyone, they must do such as that.
  They must be made for the public - must be representative of the public.
  If these technologies aren't taking into account the vast amount of users that could use it, then it might be best to put a hold on giving out AI tools to the public who doesn't understand the deficits it may have.

* [Can A.I. Help Casinos Cut Down on Problem Gambling?](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/08/technology/ai-casinos-gambling-problems.html)

  Alan Feldman, a 30+ year executive with MGM Resorts International, focuses on problem gambling.
  A few years ago, at ICE London, a mjor event in the gaming industry, showcased an AI model to identify problem gambling.
  However, Feldman is skeptical of using AI to identify problem gambling.
  Contrary to intuition, problem gamblers are not desirable to gambling operators since they can be fined or have their license revoked for not identifying problem gamblers.
  So [Mindway Ai](https://mindway.ai/) developed a model to predict problem gambling using 14 factors, given a score from 1-100, such as canceled bank withdrawals, shifts in the time of day a player plays, erratic changes in wagers, and money and time spent.
  Their motivation is that the model "predicts and catches players as their play devolves."
  However, there is a debate of how to communicate the model's results to a player so that the behavior can be changed.
  Feldman believes that at this stage, he is skeptical of AI's ability to do that.
  In my opinion, the idea of tracking people's gambling behavior to catch them before they devlop a problem sounds fascinating.
  I do believe that there is a major benefit in flaggin players who might have these problems and it is difficult to see the downside of doing so.
  I think that if a network between gambling operators, both physically and online, were created, people with these problems would be able to be tracked so that they don't just go to a different place once one has stopped letting them play.
  I am interested to see what kind of investments go into the actually getting people help because if the result of this is just not allowing people with problems to play they will find other options and little progress will be made.

* [How Native Americans Are Trying to Debug A.I.’s Biases](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/22/technology/ai-data-indigenous-ivow.html)

  At the annual conference for the American Indian Science and Engineering Society there was a workshop, Teaching Heritage to Artificial Intelligence Through Storytelling, where Native American technology students were tasked with putting tags on culturally relevent images.
  The goal was to train an alogirthm to understand the cultural meaning behind an image.
  They then compared the tags students gave to images to the ones generated by "major image recognition apps[s]".
  The apps misidentified photos and their results were "outlandish" and "offensive."
  Data on cultures that have been marginalized is insufficient, so [Davar Ardalan](https://www.npr.org/people/194281381/davar-ardalan) created [Intelligent Voices of Wisdom (IVOW)](https://www.ivow.ai/) to preserve cultures through AI to counter bias in current algorithms.
  Ardalan's goal is to use IVOW to develop tools to create cultural engines so that groups can generate and take ownership of their data.
  My biggest reservation with the data collection of marginalized groups is the potential for misuse.
  However, I think that by this communities creating their own data and taking ownership of it, that potential decreases.
  When working with and creating culturally relevent data, I think it's integral for the groups that are going to be the focus of the data to play a role in the process, from design and to implementation.
  I was excited to see a community like this come together and work toward producing such an important tool and am curious to see how this can be applied to different communities.

* [The AI Illusion--State-of-the-Art Chatbots Aren't What They Seem](https://mindmatters.ai/2022/03/the-ai-illusion-state-of-the-art-chatbots-arent-what-they-seem/)

  In this article, the author, Smith, provides several examples of conversations he had with the GPT-3 chatbot that appear to indicate human labelers manually fixed GPT-3's initial faulty response.
  In each of his examples, Smith asks GPT-3 an absurd question to which GPT-3 responds with either an illogical or a formatted, evasive response.
  The next day, Smith asks the same question, but GPT-3 now gives a sensible answer.
  Although OpenAI does publicize on its website that it hires 40 human contractors to clean up answers from GPT-3 that are flagged as bad, many still take GPT-3's abilities at face value.
  I believe the over-inflation of GPT-3's level of understanding is just one manifestation of society's general optimism and mystisism toward AI.
  In the case of GPT-3, these feelings are also exasperated by GPT being seen a spearhead of modern AI, a position which may also put pressure on OpenAI to uphold grand expectations.

* [Uber may be close to making a deal with SF taxis to allow Uber users to hail a taxi through the app](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/28/technology/uber-taxis-san-francisco-deal.html)

  This article discusses Uber's plans to make connections with San Francisco taxi services and allow customers to hail taxis through the Uber app. The article talks about how this is an interesting move, because in the past, especially in San Francisco, Uber and Taxi companies have been in strong opposition. If this agreement is to actually work out, it would emphasize the amount of power that tech companies like Uber have in getting their way. However, the article discusses that there is a significant amount of resistance to this; taxi drivers are concerned that too much power would be given to Uber in affecting their pricing, as well as their autonomy as taxi drivers. I agree that this could be concerning, because Uber has a record of not looking out for their driver's best interests. The article discussed the history of Uber refusing to recognize their drivers as employees, instead considering them as independent contractors, which means that the company is not required to provide as many benefits to drivers, and they have less protections in terms of general job security. I found this article interesting because I am fascinated by the interactions between these large, powerful tech companies and legislation, because oftentimes there is little precedent for the actions that these companies are taking, which makes it very hard to regulate. Additionally, with the pace that technology moves at, it is nearly impossible for our legislation to keep up. I think that for this specific example that Uber is looking to gain power over one of the main groups that oppose it (Taxi services), and I think that it is important for those in opposition to this to have a strong platform to fight against it, because I personally don't think it is in the best interest of the taxi companies, and Uber is just looking to grab more power and squash its competition. I think overall this article well encapsulates the current state of our society in relation to large, powerful tech companies, and emphasizes that we need to keep up in terms of regulations and laws that adequately control these companies.

* [Bungie slams YouTube for DMCA 'security loophole' and lousy customer service](https://www.pcgamer.com/bungie-slams-youtube-for-dmca-security-loophole-and-lousy-customer-service/)

  A few weeks ago Bungie, the developer of Destiny 2, saw content on YouTube related to Destiny receiving DMCA takedowns from a bad actor abusing the copyright system on YouTube. Bungie is criticizing YouTube for giving an unauthorized individual access to copyright protections and is taking legal action against the bad actors. YouTube likes to take a “hands off” approach to DMCA claims in favor for more automation due to the number of videos posted in the platform everyday. However, this approach allowed a malicious third party to abuse the system, harming the reneve of legitimate content creators and even striking down videos on Bungie’s own channel. This is a good example of the current copyright issues that come with internet content. Companies have every right to protect their properties, however the systems in place are easily abused and can harm people and now even the legitimate rights holders of intellectual property.

* [Valve says sanctions are blocking payments to Steam game devs in Ukraine, Russia](https://www.polygon.com/23003359/valve-steam-ukraine-russia-developers-bank-regulations-payment)

  Due to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, game developers in these regions are unable to receive income from Steam sales because the bank that delivers funds is blocked by economic sanctions. These developers have asked Valve when they can find a way to get their money but Valve does not know when they will be able to deliver the funds. This is one of many economic hardships brought about by the war in Ukraine. These developers depend on that income for their livelihood, so they must be struggling to make ends meet. It is reassuring that a solution may present itself to give the developers their money, but it is far away and is guaranteed.

* [Quantum computers are many years away from cracking crypto: MIT Tech Review](https://cointelegraph.com/news/quantum-computers-are-years-away-from-cracking-crypto-mit-tech-review)

  Current crypto currencies and blockchain technology is not possible to hack with current computing power; however, when quantum computers are developed this could be a problem. The processing power of a quantum computer would invalidate all modern cryptography, thus making the large quantity of money on the blockchain unsafe when that day comes. Many scientists are working on quantum-proof cryptography that would allow the blockchain to not be hacked wide open. Quantum computing would be a massive technological achievement that could improve our society, but it can also cause problems. A great leap in technology is always inevitable, so we must prepare for the day quantum computing is a reality or any other significant technological leap is achieved for the possible negative consequences it could have on society.

* [How Robots Can Assist Students With Disabilities?](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/technology/ai-robots-students-disabilities.html)

  Social robots are robots used to teach social and educational skills and children with disabilities respond to robots differently than puppets or pet therapy.
  This article the ways that social robots can be used to help these children.
  Two examples of these robots are Jibo and [QTRobot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TJx5zX_RDo), in-home social robots for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in the form of a glowing table lamp developed as part of a [research study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.aat7544) and a small full bodied robot commercially developed by LuxAI.
  There is some questions around if robots are effective at mimicking the body language and social cues which are essential for the development of social skills.
  Lastly, Maithile Kunda created a videogame, ["Film Detective"](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/news/2020/film-detective-helps-kids-with-autism-interpret-actors-actions/), to help children with autism, many whom hace superior visual thinking, by giving them visual ways to imagine theory of mind.
  These developments introduce developments in interesting support technologies for the home and classroom, but are they as effective in the development of social skills as interacting with people are?
  It would seem intuitive that the best way for these children to develop social skills is to socialize.
  I liked "Film Detective" the most out of all these technologies because it seems to be the one with the least barriers. A videogame usually costs less than $50 USD, which is much more financially feasable for families than the $2000 cost of a QTRobot, not including the $129 "software subscription" cost. Will technologies that are supposed to increase accesibility to children with disabilities be financially accessible to these families?

* [Beating noise pollution with smart tech](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60858571)

  Noise pollution is an underestimated threat that effects millions worldwide, mainly in urban areas. Noise pollution can cause short and long term health problems such as sleep disturbance, cardiovascular problems, poor work and school performance, and hearing impariment. Tech companies like Silentium have taken note of this and attempted to derive a solution. They have a "Quiet Bubble" system that can significantly reduce unwanted noise using active noise cancellation. At its core, the system works by using a microphone to take in external noise and process it, then it uses a speaker to release the same sound waves but in oppposite phase. This creates interference and cancels out most of each sound. This technology has existed in noise cancelling headphones for years but Silentium is trying to integrate it in peoples personal lives, in cars or homes for example. I think that tech companies using their technology to help society with ever emerging new issues such as increased noise pollution is always a positive. This specific issue is interesing because while it affects millions worldwide, it is largely ignored by society. As a result, I am skeptical of the long term popularity of this technology because many will chose to save money and continue to cope with their city's noise.

* [E.U. passes Digital Markets Act to regulate 'gatekeeper' tech companies like Apple, Google, etc.](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/technology/eu-regulation-apple-meta-google.html)

  The European Union recently passed the Digital Markets Act, which is aimed to tether large tech companies that monopolize their respective areas. This act is intended to give smaller or competitor companies a chance to compete and have their products utilized to a greater extent, which is often not possible because currently large companies are able to squash competition through a variety of means. The article was fairly vague regarding all the enforcements promised by the act, but they mention a couple specifics. One was that companies will be limited to the extent that they can store user data for the purpose of creating targeted adds. Another is that companies like Apple would be required to allow app downloads from other parties, not just through their own App Store (this seems most directly related to the goal of giving competitor platforms/companies an opportunity to have their products utilized, since companies like Apple would have less say in filtering out apps from being used on their platforms/devices). One possibly valid concern that Apple brought up in response to this was that limiting the control that they have over what apps can be downloaded is that it could lead to security issues, because Apple has less ability to audit what apps are downloadable. I would also be concerned about how this act is actually going to be enforced, and whether whoever is enforcing it has enough knowledge of the technology to be able to intervene and detect whether companies are abiding by it. Additionally, regulations like these sort of seem like temporary fixes to existing issues, but companies can likely find other ways around it or develop in new ways that circumvent these kinds of regulations.

  A man named James Vlahos lost his father to cancer in 2017 but still chats with him all the time
  thanks to a chatbot he created called “Dadbot.” Vlahos spent months recording his dad’s life
  stories, then turned them into an interactive AI that speaks in his father’s voice. Vlahos is
  bringing his technology to HereAfter AI, one of many startups promising digital immortality
  through chatbots, AI, and even holograms. The prospect of communicating with virtual versions
  of dead family members of friends is certainly controversial. On the one had this can be a great
  initiative, helping people through their grieving process. On the other hand, it can be considered
  creepy and can be potentially dangerous if the AI reveals information about the person, that
  wasn't communicated while they were alive, which can create confusion or even resentment.
  This also poses ethical concerns and begs philosophical questions.

* [The Fragile Open Source Ecosystem Isn’t Ready for ‘Protestware’](https://www.wired.com/story/open-source-sabotage-protestware/)

  Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent shockwaves across the globe. Now it seems these shockwaves are beginning to make their way into open source software. Over the past week those maintaining such open source code bases have begun to find a series of deliberate attempts at sabotage. These attempts at sabotage are targeted specifically at Russian machines as a means to support Ukrainian war efforts. Open source projects have been embedded with various forms of malware, from data wipers to ransomware attacks. This proves troubling to an already shaky space as many open source projects are severely underfunded or understaffed, often times both. This can mean the vandalized could can go unnoticed. This not only sets a dangerous precedent for software to take a political stance, but it also severely undermines public opinion and faith in the open source ecosystem.

  As is the case with all things Apple, their newest M1 chips are in a walled garden. Although Apple's newest processor is just about to turn 2, it still boasts some of the most impressive benchmarks when compared to other high-end consumer processors. This performance is made all the more sour by the fact that these processors can't support x86 based software. This means Windows and Linux can't run on these machines, unless using some tricky workaround like parallels or another emulator. This however has changed thanks to the release of Asahi Linux. Asahi Linux is the newest distro that seeks to natively run a Linux distribution on the bare metal of an M1 Macbook. Just lask week they released one of their first alpha's with dozens of working features. Although much is still left to be done with a lot of features on the to-do list, what's here is absolutely promising.

  A new week, a new union vote for Amazon employees. Last April Amazon was victorious when its employees at the Bessemer Alabama fulfillment voted to not unionize. This victory however seems to be short lived after the National Labor Relations board voted to allow a second vote after allegations surfaced that Amazon engaged in illegal action when attempting to convince employees not to unionize. While voting has already begun, in fact it began almost a month ago on February 4th. Tallying will began on March 28th, to reveal if Amazon will have another victory or union's will finally get a much needed win. All of this occurs as various retail stores and companies across the country began to unionize. Starbucks, REI, and Amazon are among the few of many large corporate chains who have been facing its employees' vote to unionize.

  The Texas attorney general has now filed a suit against Meta Platforms alleging that Facebook violated privacy law within the state for the way it handled biometrics. The biometrics and facial recognition cited in the lawsuit was scrapped back in November of 2021, however, Texas AG Ken Paxton stated that for over a decade the existence of facial geometric data within Facebook's platform has resulted in the violation of Texas law. Within the lawsuit Mr. Paxton stated that "Facebook has been secretly harvesting Texans' personal information... for its own corporate profit" and that to do so without informed consent is illegal. Within the Texas law a single privacy infraction draws a $25,000 fine, over the course of the decade Facebook has broken that law millions of times, meaning Texas officials are asking for hundreds of billions of dollars in restitution. It should also be noted that this lawsuit has come about after Facebook settled with the state of Illinois for their class-action lawsuit regarding similar grievances with Facebook's facial recognition and data collection practices.

  Gary Bowser, a Canadian national who had been extradited to the United States from the Dominican Republic, has been sentenced to 3 years in prison and ordered to pay a fine totalling $4.5 million to Nintendo of America. Bowser had previously pled guilty to the federal charges of Conspiracy to Circumvent Technological Measures and to Traffic in Circumvention Devices, and Trafficking in Circumvention Devices back in October 2021. Bowser was the main man behind a team of hackers known as 'Team Xecuter' who were known for their Nintendo Switch homebrew and jailbreaking software. During the trial Nintendo alleged that Bowser "caused more than $65 million in losses to videogame companies, but the damage goes beyond these businesses, harming videogame developers and the small, creative studios whose products and hard work is essentially stolen when games are pirated". While Nintendo getting angry at software modders isn't new, the Federal Government getting involved and handing out hefty finds and jailtime certainly is. Bowser's sentencing has many wondering if this represents a era of piracy prevention on the part of the US government.

* [We met the founder of Europe's largest vertical farm](https://thechoice.escp.eu/their-choice/we-met-the-founder-of-europes-largest-vertical-farm/amp/)

  Nordic Harvest, Europe's largest vertical farm, is located in the Danish city of Taastrup, and spans over 7,000 square feet with 14 levels of agriculture. Providing about 5% of Denmark's consumption, the farm produces over 1,000 tons of salad and herbs each year, powered entirely by wind energy and low-energy LEDs. Vertical farming is an incredible tool for resource optimization, providing crops that can be harvested much more frequently than regular, keep for longer without rotting, use zero pesticides, and maintain the same flavor and nutritional profile. Because of this effectivness, vertical farming has the potential to greatly supplement the food supply chain, reduce food waste, and reduce food transportation. Thus, even though the intial cost of vertical farming infrastructure is hefty, vertical farming is in a position to support the never-ending rise in human population alongside booming urbanization while still reducing energy consumption and waste.

  Ars Technica's article discusses how an author for a popular open-source Node package added malicious code that overwrites a user's file system with heart emojis—if the user has a Russian or Belarusian IP address. The motive behind this was to attack Russian and Belarusian systems in support of Ukraine, and the package modified is a dependency for Vue.js, one of the most popular web development frameworks. This could potentially draw some negative flack to open-source models, as the security of their code is contingent on community trust and good peer review practices. However, this also raises security questions for projects and libraries that pull in large amounts of dependencies through npm.

  The Vanderbilt baseball has implemented a new piece of technology this season in order to not only improve the pace of play of the game of baseball, but also to improve communication between players on their team. Basically, the players on the field all wear a wristband that has a screen that will display the pitch that the pitcher is supposed to throw. The pitcher knows what pitch he is supposed to throw instantly and so does the catcher and the rest of the fielder behind him. This means that the time it took for a catcher to relay signs from the coach to a pitcher is cut in half while also allowing for every other player on the team to know what will be thrown as well. The device works as the coach presses a button and it sends a short secure signal to each device. This device is a sign that the sports world is becoming more tech involved as for the first time we are seeing players with an electronic device on their bodies. The pitcher and catcher are able to communicate without the use of words or even hand signals. The players are able to be told what to do by their coach without the coach having to be vocal enough for the other team to hear him. These devices do not use bluetooth and have a range of about 500 feet, so even players on the opposite side of the field are able to still receive the sign from the coach.

  When doctors see a patient who only speaks a less common language, Google Translate is oftentimes their best option to communicate important information like discharge instructions.
  However, Google Translate was not built to be used for medical translation.
  Medical translation is distinct from other types of translation because there are many domain-specific terms and any small mistranslation could have huge effect on the patient's health.
  Thus, there is a pressing need in the medical field for a real-time translation tool specifically trained on medical records, that would be used alongside human translators.
  This article identifies a couple of teams that are working on different approaches to this task, including independent researchers and a Microsoft subsidary.

  This article talks about how California is creating a government agency for regulating tech companies
  to try to ensure that user privacy is protected. This is a good idea, although it will be interesting
  to see if this will have any effect. The article discusses how there is not really much of an
  established precedent for how such an agency should behave and what it can really do. This makes sense,
  because technology has moved so rapidly that the laws have not been able to keep up, and there is no
  established way of enforcing or even knowing what rules to place on tech companies. This is where the
  main concern with such an agency might arise. I think for such an agency to be effective, it is important
  that the individuals involved in enforcing privacy protections have some sort of technical background to
  be able to have an understanding of what exactly they are trying to regulate. I think this brings up an
  important general point; given the slow moving nature of our legislative systems in the US, it is difficult
  for our laws to keep up with how quickly technology is advancing. I think this emphasizes the importance
  of having individuals who are well versed in technology involved in making new regulations, as opposed to
  people who don't have much experience in these fields.

  The company  Lune claims that their newly created API is important to combat climate change. This is because companies usually only have their sustainability reports hidden somewhere in their website and very few people end up reading it. That is why Lune is offering an API that exposes CO2 emissions calculations of products at checkout so that customers are better informed of the enviomental impacts of purchasing things online. By having a CO2 emmision calculation at checkout, it will allow people to be more conscious of their enviormental impact of the good they are purchasing.  Additionally, companies can let their customers donate money to finance a carbon neutralization project at checkout. It can be argued that the best way to reduce carbon emmsions is to not purchase the product in the first place. However, by providing the CO2 emmsion calulation, it is possible that people will be less inclined to purchase the good. Additionally, if they have to purchase the good, it is useful that customers can help contribute to carbon offset projects.

This possibility is highly dangerous, since deepfakes have the potential to incite conflict due to misinformation and harm society in that way.

* [3 Questions: Fotini Christia on racial equity and data science](https://news.mit.edu/2022/3-questions-fotini-christia-racial-equity-and-data-science-0303)

  Recently, a MIT-wide effort was launched to address systemic racism with the help of social science and computation. By using lots of data, they hope to develop tools that can create "structural and normative change toward equity". As of recently, existing data has shown racial discrimination in many avenues of the job market, including education and healthcare. Data science tools "can not only identify, but also contribute to, proposing fixes on racially inequitable outcomes that result from implicit or explicit biases [from]... the use of AI and algorithmic methods in decision-making". After creating these tools, they will place them in neighborhoods where indirect systemic racism exists (e.g. neighborhoods with minorities) and test these tools for their racial equity. Computation comes into play with "causal analysis" of these racial disparities and how the several structures and institutions within society have all played a role in systemic racism (both now and overtime). As a whole, this movement (ICSR) is a part of the IDSS and Fotini Christia, who looks to research issues of conflict and cooperation in the Muslim world, but has since extended to investigating systemic racism with the help of social sciences, data science, and computation.

* [3 Questions: How the MIT mini cheetah learns to run](https://news.mit.edu/2022/3-questions-how-mit-mini-cheetah-learns-run-fast-0317)

  Running for robots has been a huge (and very difficult) leap to accomplish; CSAIL scientists at MIT came up with a "learning pipeline" for a four-legged robot which can learn to run "entirely by trial and error in simulation." To break down why running for robots is so difficult, has to do with how humans adapt to the ground they traverse; if a robot were to only walk like it would on ice everywhere, it's not very inefficient. As well as, running everywhere not only increases the chances of falling, but pushes the hardware of the robot to its limits (such as with "near[ing] the maximum torque output of motors."). To finalize the issue, a normal approach of "programming how a robot should act in every possible situation is simply very hard [and tedious]." With the new approach by these scientists, the robot can accumulate "100 days’ worth of experience on diverse terrains in just three hours of actual time...[where] the robot's behavior improves from simulated experience." With all the environments the robot sees (while simulated), the controller will be able to identify, execute, and learn new skills to conquer these simulated environments (i.e. run and traverse without falling). While skeptics may argue the scalability of this approach, however the scientists argue that their apporach is far more scalable than the normal apporach for teaching robots. The "learning pipeline" is meant to build a diverse set of skills which the robot can utilize, rather than just having the coder hardcode every situation into the robot. With scalability in mind, the scientists continue to apply this approach on other systems, including "hands that can pick up and manipulate other objects".

* [Scientists and farmers see ways to make AI useful to agriculture](https://news.ufl.edu/2022/03/innovations-in-agriculture-conference/)

  A three-day conference was held recently, from March 9-11, entitled "Envisioning
  2050 in the Southeast: AI-driven Innovations in Agriculture," with a focus on seeing
  how artificial intelligence can help the agriculture field. At the core of the ideas shown
  at the conference was an emphasis on collaborating with those who already work in the field
  to find real ways to improve the quality of life. This is a very positive take on artificial
  intelligence and how it can bring about an improvement to both the lives of growers and,
  ideally, everyone else as access to fresh produce is increased. Far too often we discuss
  the negatives that come with AI; while they are certainly there, it is also nice to see how
  it is currently being used to solve important problems such as those found in the agricultural
  sector.

  Tech startup Injectsense has been developing an eye implant built to measure intraocular pressure, a significant risk factor for glaucoma.
  The device is injected into the eye painlessely and is capable of staying in your eye for over 80 years, charged by a pair of special glasses.
  Based on recent animal studies performed by the company that showed high levels of success and no major issues, the National Eye institute recently awarded Injectsense with a 1.7 million dollar grant.
  While eye pressure is something routinely measured by an eye doctor, the device stands out because it can transmit the eye pressure data continously, which allows for better insight into the daily fluctuations in eye pressure that most people experience.
  Although the device is not necessarily a "flashy" implementation of injectable technology, the possibility of continous sensing means people at risk for or living with glaucoma can gain a better picture of the progression of the condition and build better plans of care with their doctor.

  After the new restrictions were announced, more than 70 Taiwanese companies operating in the city and dozens of local Chinese manufacturers said they had suspended production. "China is digging itself into a deep hole with its zero Covid policy," said Olaf Schatteman, a supply chain expert at Bain, the consultancy. "As the restrictions are hurting suppliers and logistics operations, companies are moving beyond containing the current crisis and towards diversifying production locations, undermining China as the supply chain hub of the world". Analysts said the impact on Apple remained limited because the main iPhone production site at Foxconn, its largest supplier, was in Zhengzhou, a central Chinese city not affected at this time. "We think this is a manageable issue especially if it's limited to one week, the challenges could be more supply chain problems for the tech ecosystem and further pressure on supply/logistics overall," Evercore ISI said in a research note. An internal report from a technology company in Shenzhen obtained by the Financial Times called the domestic epidemic control situation "very serious" and said it had a cascading effect on shipments. Phelix Lee, a technology analyst at Morningstar in Hong Kong, said the migration of many technology manufacturing plants from Shenzhen to several other hubs in China and elsewhere meant the widespread factory closures in the city were less catastrophic than they would have been a few years ago. Luxshare, a Chinese contract electronics manufacturer with a rapidly growing share of Apple orders, makes some cables and interconnectors in its Shenzhen plants. "They are being disrupted because they could not ship to Foxconn," Lee said. "It could be quite significant".

  A restaurant group in Florida sues Google for directing users to food delivery apps instead of restaurants’ own delivery services. They claim that Google never obtained permission from restaurants to sell their food via third party delivery services and is purposely making it appear as though it has. Google defends itself by stating that restaurants can opt out of, and even choose, their preferred delivery service. Additionally, Google does not profit from prioritizing certain delivery apps so there is no reason to believe that they would be doing it on purpose.

  Didi shares tumbled 44% on Friday, the biggest one-day drop since the Chinese ride-hailing company went public in the U.S. in June. The stock is now 87% below its IPO price, leaving its two top shareholders — SoftBank and Uber — facing the potential for steep losses. The shares were already in freefall amid a crackdown by the Chinese government on domestic companies listed in the U.S. Didi said in December that it would delist from the New York Stock Exchange and instead list in Hong Kong. On Friday, Bloomberg reported that Didi hadn’t complied with data-security requirements necessary to proceed with a share sale in Hong Kong. Uber said in its latest annual report that in 2021 it recognized an unrealized $3 billion loss on its Didi investment. Last year CNBC reported that SoftBank was selling part of its Uber position partly to cover its Didi losses. “Since we invested in Didi, we have seen a huge loss of value,” Masayoshi Son, SoftBank’s CEO, said in a February call to discuss results for the nine months ended Dec. 31. Didi wasn’t the only Chinese tech stock to drop on Friday, though its decline was the heftiest.

* [China’s tech platforms become propaganda tools in Putin’s war](https://www.ft.com/content/d460c6f6-ffc7-4d61-9350-bef378fcc5c5)

  The Ukraine invasion is casting an unflattering light on the role of China's private technology groups, including Tencent, Sina Weibo and ByteDance, in disseminating official misinformation, posing difficult compliance issues for the companies' foreign investors. The internet platforms of tech giants in China are promoting content backing Russian president Vladimir Putin's attack on Ukraine while suppressing posts that are sympathetic to Kyiv, potentially conflicting with international funds' corporate and social responsibility commitments and public statements against the war. This week, Russian disinformation reports of US-run biological laboratories in Ukraine with "large quantities of dangerous viruses" were repeated by China's foreign ministry spokesperson and state media. "The Chinese market is uninvestable from an ESG perspective," said Felix Boudreault, managing director of Sustainable Market Strategies, an environmental, social and corporate governance investment research group. Many of the companies most popular with investors were subject to strict state controls, said Boudreault, adding that tech and media companies were "extremely vulnerable to the strike of a pen from a Chinese bureaucrat". Moscow's talking points are frequently adopted from Russian state media and run on China's platforms as well as being parroted by Chinese officials, state media and a chorus of nationalist influencers. Investments in Chinese platforms are becoming "problematic" from a social responsibility perspective, said one Hong Kong-based executive at an international fund whose portfolio includes Chinese internet company shares. "It is a tough market, getting tougher," said the investor, who asked not to be named citing Hong Kong's national security laws, which target criticism of China. "Investors should be able to engage with companies on these issues. The focus on China's tech giants and their investors comes as western governments push international social media companies to remove Russian state-backed media from their platforms. He added that investors had also largely ignored the sector's alleged ties to surveillance in China's western Xinjiang region where one million Muslims have been imprisoned. "One of the issues which is most concerning is the sheer level of passive investment in these companies, particularly Tencent and Alibaba.

  Russian Internet users VPNs to view world's opion on the ukraine war while putin controls the media within russia and limit their freedom of speech using violent force and new technologies. Russian internet users are increasingly relying on virtual private networks (VPNs) and encrypted messaging applications to circumvent government restrictions. According to experts, Putin may have unintentionally triggered a significant, long-lasting shift in computer literacy that will work against him for years. Since March 1, Russian internet traffic to Signal has increased by a "substantial amount." Since the Ukraine invasion, Tor, a service that directs internet traffic through government firewalls, has witnessed a 2,000 percent surge in downloads from Russia. Telegram and Lantern, two private chat apps, are also thriving in Russia in the aftermath of the invasion. Russian internet users face grave dangers as the Kremlin cracks down on social media. For years, some Russian internet users have used secure communication programs. Kremlin supporters can still attempt to lure them into Russia's broader information war. If only a small proportion of citizens use such tools, Putin may be able to monopolize the country's information arena. The proliferation of anti-censorship technologies may herald the start of a "J-curve" in Russia, according to security expert Meinrath.

  The article focuses on how certain platforms, specifically Netflix and Tik Tok, have cut off their services in Russia amidst the invasion of Ukraine. Tik Tok has suspended live streaming and new content as the company tries to slow the spread of “fake news” regarding Russian armed forces. Tik tok explains this as a safety measure to ensure the protection of its staff and its users. According to the article, anyone reported writing “fake news” about the military can have upto 15 years in prison. There are approximately 36 million Russian Tik Tok-users, making it one of the company’s largest territories. Russian users can currently only view content; the restrictions on producing content is to protect people from being charged with “fake news”. Tik Tok has only recently released a statement regarding the invasion of Ukraine saying it was “devastating” and that it brought “pain to our community and our people”. Netflix has, since last week, halted all projects in Russia and stopped streaming services. Other companies have suspended operations: Burberry, H&M, Jaguar Land Rover, Apple. Visa, Mastercard and American Express have also suspended operations.

  Many tech companies, such as Apple, Microsoft, and Samsung, are either limiting or completely stopping sales of their products in Russia. This is largely due to the political tensions between Ukraine that have taken root there. Additionally, companies have also ceased advertisements on social media sites, and streaming services are holding off on releasing movies and tv shows. This will overall make it difficult to purchase phones, games, and more in Russia, perhaps leading to inflated prices of these products in the market.

  Recently, Steam has banned blockchain and NFT games, to the annoyance of gamers who are fans of crypto.
  The decision is precedented by Steam's short-lived experiment with accepting Bitcoin as payment, which started in Apr 2016 and ended Dec 2017.
  Steam's reasoning for dropping support for Bitcoin was the extreme fluctuation it caused in the price of a game by the day, and the high amount of fraud that came with the crypto scene.
  Gabe Newell, president of Steam's parent company Valve, comments, "There's a lot of really interesting technology in blockchains... but I think that people haven't figured out why you actually need a distributed ledger."
  Newell's comment reflects rising concerns around the "overhype" of blockchain technology, and critiques on appropriate use and limitations of crypto.

  The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency is aiming to incorporate biometric facial recognition with its new identification system. The technology they use (Simple Arrival) uses facial recognition which compares a current photo of the person being identified and their passport photo using a computer algorithm. There are a few concerns regarding this automated method of identification, the first one having to do with privacy. Some privacy advocates have voiced their skepticism regarding this process, demanding insurance that "flagged individuals are treated in a safe, fair and noninvasive manner given the imperfection of facial recognition software.” Another worry that surfaced was regarding bias in the programming that could lead to higher rates of errors for some groups, including people of color. The article claims that the C.B.P. has partnered up with the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the algorithm shows “virtually no demonstrable difference when it comes to demographics.”

  This article discusses US sanctions against Russia's tech-economy to disrupt its military capabilities. The sanctions include the ban of exporting
  chip technology to Russia by US based companies, such as Intel and Nvidia. The sanction is specifically targeted for chip technology meant for
  military purposes and would not stop Russian citizens from buying normal technology goods, such as mobile phones. This move mirrors that of US sanctions
  against Huawei a couple years before due to security concerns, but use of the same sanctions today brings concern of Chinese companies moving in to
  supply Russia the chip technology instead. However, a senior Biden official remarks "China alone can't supply all of Russia's critical needs" and this
  seems reasonable given that China accounts for only 16 percent of global semiconductor prodcution, so such an outcome is unlikely. Nonetheless, the tech
  sanctions reflect a US response in limiting Russia's military aggression with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.

  This article is discussing the news restriction sanctions being put in place by the Russian government as the invasion of Ukraine is currently happening. The article explains how these policies have severely limited the flow of information in a state of national crisis. The websites which have been most  restricted for many Russian citizens are Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Fact checking by Meta— who owns media platforms like Facebook and Instagram— and the allowance of views that stand in opposition to Russian media outlets to persevere. Meta has restricted certain Russian officials on some platforms resulting in the state demanding these sanctions be lifted. Meta refused arguing that their apps are allowing many users to spread information and mobilize. Meta is currently trying to make their apps accessible and partnered with an outside organization , Reuters, to fact-check and stop the spread of disinformation. There is limited information still concerning how Russian will continue to limit other Meta apps, like WhatsApp.

  Russia is fighting with several social media platforms (such as Meta and Twitter), because they are trying
  to restrict Russia's ability to spread false information about their recent invasion of Ukraine. Social
  Media platforms have been facing pressure to crack down on Russia, and many individuals are calling for platforms
  to straight out prohibit Russians from using these services. Interestingly, Russia is also starting to restrict
  the ability for its citizens to use services like Facebook and Twitter, probably to make it more difficult for
  its citizens to see outside information about the conflict with Ukraine. The question of whether companies like
  Facebook and Twitter should ban Russian users brings up interesting ethical discussion, and the leaders of these
  companies are having to grapple with what to do in this situation. Meta's global affairs department determined
  that it would cause more detriment to ban Russians from using Facebook. This could be the case because much of the
  Russian media is spreading lots of propaganda. However, this is definitely an interesting issue because it shows
  how decisions by these tech companies have serious implications for real world issues.

  Some MIT researchers have created a method that is able to point out anomalies in real time from data streams in an efficient way. This model does not need to be trained on annotated data on power grid anomalies, which makes it suitable for real life situations that don’t have cleaned up data of good quality. One possible use of the model includes monitoring traffic and water systems. Although other models do exist, the researchers conclude that their model performs better when it comes to pointing out anomalies. This is because their model was able to detect a higher percent of the true anomalies that existed in the datasets that were tested.

* [Toward a stronger defense of personal data](https://news.mit.edu/2022/application-specific-integrated-circuit-iot-chip-0218)

  Researchers at MIT have developed an "application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip", with the power to defend against "side-channel" attacks, or attacks that seek to gather secret information via an exploitation of a system and/or its hardware. An example of a side attack is the exploitation of the hardware on a smartwatch by inspecting the device's power consumption to get private health data about the individual. The ASIC chip answers this issue by using "threshold computing", which splits the data into "unique, random components" which are then operated on in a random order as well before getting the final result. Their chip was a success as with the default implementation "they were able to recover hidden information... in about 1000 power waveforms (representations of power usage over time)". Whereas, with the new hardware, "even after collecting 2 million waveforms, they still could not recover the data". However, now the main issue that has come up is the design: while it provides significant security against these attacks, "the chip requires 5.5 times more power and 1.6 times more silicon area than a baseline insecure implementation." The researchers, however, argue that "[We're willing to trading] off some amount of energy consumption to make a more secure computation", arguing that it can be utilized while more energy-sustainable models are created in the future.

* [Using artificial intelligence to find anomalies hiding in massive datasets](https://news.mit.edu/2022/artificial-intelligence-anomalies-data-0225)

  In complex grid data such as power grid or water grid data, determining the probabilities of anomalies (such as a spike in voltage) is very difficult, as power grid data consists of many incoming data points very second from different sensors across the grid. At IBM-Watson's MIT AI Lab, researchers have devised an efficient method for determining these malfunctions in data streams in real time, and turning these complex probabilities into more managable ones. They argue that their artifical intelligence method is much better at detecting them than other popular techniques. Deriving this method involved using concepts in Baynesian networks, individual probabilities, probability density, and even techniques in deep learning like "normalizing form" which allow an artifical intelligence to see a complicated network of multidimensional data points as an interconnected Baynesian network or interconnected grid. As the AI learns the causal structure of the data it receives, it can begin to construct causal structures between sensors and convert otherwise complex probabilities into more managable ones for researchers to investigate.
  In preparing and testing this method, they used previous data of grid networks such as power grid data, water grid data, and traffic data which contains anomalies that'd been previously identified and solved by humans. What they found was that their model "outperformed all the baselines by detecting a higher percentage of true anomalies in each dataset". To go further, their model involved no supervision, as the AI learns on its own this causal grid structure; the researchers hope that this solution can be mapped to other datasets and complex forms of data.

* [Tesla’s reverse on battery cells signals shift for electric vehicles](https://www.ft.com/content/accde2e1-08a2-4bc3-bbb1-1a1e72eb4508)

  This article by June Yoon delves into Tesla’s recent decision for
  its cars to start using lithium iron phosphate batteries. This is
  caused by the recent surge in prices for raw materials in the world
  of batteries for electric cars. The article points out how this type
  of battery is widely used for less sophisticated devices such as
  golf carts and residential back-up power systems. But iron-based
  batteries are a much less efficient option for electric cars as they
  have a lower energy density than the nickel, cobalt, and manganese
  batteries, which are currently used in most electric cars. Being
  iron-based, these batteries will in turn offers less driving
  distance on a single charge. The main advantage in switching towards
  iron-based batteries is the price: they cost about 30 per cent per
  battery cell than their nickel-rich counterparts. Another advantage
  is that they are thermally more stable, meaning a lower risk of
  fires. Battery-caused car fires have costed companies such as
  General Motors upwards of $2 billion and Supplier LG Energy solution
  an estimated $1.2 billion. Tesla’s decision to switch to iron-based
  batteries has inspired other carmakers such as Volkswagen to plan to
  use them as well. However, a switch to iron-based batteries would
  mean a powershift for China, as the country produces more than 95%
  of iron-based battery cells and controls more than 80% of the
  world’s refining and mining aof electric car battery raw materials.

  Chinese government is on the move to regulate corperates' AI algorithm uses that set prices, control search results, recommend videos, and filter content. Some car hailing apps in china uses AI algorithm to provide different prices for different users. For instence, the platform may offer a lower price for the same ride based on users usage and price of the phone they use. In one of Prsident Xi jinping's speech in Octorber, he said there are "unhealthy and disorderly signals and trendds" regarding china's digital economy development. Based on the new 'INternet information Service Algorithmic Recommendatio Management Provisions' will enforce corperates and individual use Ai in unlawful and unhealfy ways online. Certain provisions of the new regulations may prove challenging or impossible to enforce. Controlling the behavior of an algorithm that is constantly changing due to new input, for example, might be technically tough.

  SNK decided to use the unreal engine for their latest game, The King of Fighters XV, which helped the development and quality of the final product. The unreal engine provided benefits to development such as easier time porting and enhanced shader capabilities. SNK used unreal engine for their previous title Samurai Shodown, which was a success and they are developing a future game with unreal engine. The King of Fighters XIV did not use unreal engine, but SNK was experimenting with unreal engine during that game's development, so the transition was easy.

* [Google lowered its salaries in North Carolina. Now workers are protesting.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/02/18/google-raleigh-hbcu-salary/)

  Google has lowered its employees salaries and stock benefits below national level for some of its North Carolina offices.
  Representatives from Google claim this change was to readjust to offer competitive pay relative to the local market.
  However, affected workers view the adjustment as problematic.
  This is partly because many employees moved to the area before the salary cut for the lower cost of living, and Google had "record-breaking performance in the stock market, in spite of Covid-19," and so should be rewarding its workers rather than cutting salaries.
  A larger reason for upset is also the cut happening simultaneously with Google's plans to make the company more diverse by hiring black engineers in areas like Durnham, North Carolina.
  Thus, critics raise the question of if Google is exploiting the very hires that will make their company more diverse.

  This article goes over the alarming 2021 cyber security report about the prevalence and danger of ransomware attacks.
  The report states that there were 2,686 attacks in 2021 compared to 1,474 attacks in 2020, which is an 82% increase.
  Perpetrators are evolving their approaches with ransomware, such as accessing legitamite login credentials to takeover system functions,
  as a way to bypass antivirus products. The report also notes that almost 49% of the attacks are financially motivated, and a prime example
  was the "lock and leak" attacks observed where the data is not only encrypted for ransom but also stolen to sell online. Such attacks are growing
  in popularity because of the many vulnerabilites in a company's cloud and server infrastructure that can be exploited by these attackers. It's
  with a warning that "adversaries continue to adapt to security environments" and this will only continue in 2022.

* [Losing Tech War To China? After Hypersonic Missiles, Ex-Google CEO Says US Far Behind In Another Critical Technology](https://eurasiantimes.com/google-ceo-says-us-far-behind-in-another-critical-technology/)

  The article argues that China is rapidly overtaking the United States in the competition to develop and produce what the former Google CEO, Eric Schmidt, refers to as “strategically important technology”. One of these crucial advancements is in hypersonic technology. In July of last year China conducted a hypersonic weapon test that launched a missile around the world at a speed 5x faster than the speed of sound. China has also recently expanded greatly in its investment of 5G services. China has invested approximately 50x as much in 5G technology as the United States, with a total of $50 billion investment in the country. Schmidt goes on to criticize the United State’s failure to not only effectively allocate resources to hypersonic and 5G technology, but also to high tech manufacturing, green energy and AI. The primary concern is the security threat that technological stagnation poses to the United States. In recent news, Chinese researchers claim to have successfully reached a wireless transmission speed of 206.25 gigabits per second, suggesting 6G technology may be 100x faster than 5G. This combined with hypersonic missiles highlights the growing disparity in tech design as the United States struggles to rollout 5G across the country. The only solution provided is an increased  amount of funding into research to continue securing the United States position as a global leader in technological advancement.

  Google plans to increase privacy on android apps alongside the Chrome browser. By 2023 the use of third party cookies is supposedly planned to be removed from Chrome. Overall, the sharing of user data will be more limited so that advertisers will not be able to gain much access to it. However, in the past, the article highlights that Google’s attempts to make up for third party cookies have been unsuccessful, such as in the case of Floc (Federated Learning of Cohorts). Additionally, details on specific implementation methods have not yet been provided.

  Kanye West announced this week that his upcoming album, Donda 2, would only be available on
  his "stem Player" platform, and would not be coming to normal streaming platforms. He claims
  that this is in response to the fact that artists only get 12% of the money that the industry
  makes, with streaming platforms taking large percentages. Launched with his previous album, the
  Stem Player is an interesting device that allows for the onboard music to be manipulated, although
  it was nowhere near as functional as a proper mixing device, nor is it as convenient to use as
  streaming platforms. Notably, this is not the first time Kanye has attempted to avoid mainstream
  streaming platforms, since he tried something similar several years ago. However, it seems
  less likely he will backtrack this time, unlike the last, given the current state of the music
  industry and criticism of platforms such as Spotify.

  This article discusses Apple's new software update, which includes a new feature that enables users to unlock their phone with face id even while wearing a mask. There has been a loss of one Apple's most convenient features over the last couple years as face id does not work when people wear a mask. Apple also has stated that this update should allow for better results when wearing sunglasses and/or a hat and trying to unlock your phone. This upcoming update is big news, as it means we won't have the annoying issue of typing in our passcode or pulling off our mask in public to unlock our phones. The convenience of face id is a big feature that was revolutionary when it was first released, and these new updates should improve it more. It will be interesting to see how effective the new changes are. An initial test with the beta revealed that while it was able to unlock the device with a mask on, there were still some inconsistencies. There were times that they were prompted to input their passcode to unlock the phone, but Apple will likely address this issue before releasing fully in the next update.

* [Google also enforcing rules to honor user privacy to detriment of advertisers](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/16/google-plans-android-privacy-change-similar-to-apples.html)

  Google has also announced that they will enforce policies that limit advertisers' ability to track users' activity.
  Currently, Google/Android users each have a unique ID that advertisers can use to track their activity. However,
  Google plans to revise this in the future. However, there is an important difference between Google's approach and
  that of Apple (who also recently announced changing to protect users' privacy from advertisers); Apple released their
  changes immediately, allowing users to block advertisers from tracking their activity, while Google has announced
  that their changes will not fully take effect for about two more years (they will continue supporting the user ID's
  for at least two years). This gives advertisers/social media companies who rely on them time to adjust and come up
  with new approaches. I think it is interesting that Apple and Google approached this differently, and I wonder
  whether Google's softer approach was influenced by the fact that Apple's privacy changes were met with strong
  backlash/criticism because of how abrupt their changes were.

* [Maybe Green Energy Needs 'Information Batteries' Too](https://www.wired.com/story/maybe-green-energy-needs-information-batteries-too/)

  To save on the large amount of energy used for computing, researchers suggest pre commuting information necessary and storing it away in "information batteries", during times when clean power is available and saving it for when it is not. Companies like Google and Facebook that use up alot of energy for pre computable things like search results or friend suggestions and by doing that work asynchronously and storing it, they reduce their consumption. Similar strategies are used by others who do their heavy processing at night when there is less usage by others. However, pre computing for information batteries would not be able to predict the future of what will be needed but only parts of it.

  In thie article, the author claims that more criminals chooses to use crypto currency to laundering money due to low transaction fees with while decentralisation offers criminals greater anonymity and security protection from the authorities. Chainalysis says that after tracking cryto currency wallets controleed by criminals they found that they have laundered over $8.6 billions of cryptocurrency in 2021, "up by 30%" since 2020.  According to the research, cryptocurrency laundering accounts for 17% of all monies sent from unlawful wallets, up from 2% in 2016. Money from offline crime, such as drug trafficking funds converted to cryptocurrencies to be laundered, is not covered, and the report warns that this could be a growing area. The paper claims that this is low in comparison to more traditional ways of money laundering, "suggesting that Bitcoin-based laundering could become increasingly attractive to traditional criminals."

  established firms to find jobs in crypto and other decentralized
  tech ventures. A leading example of this is how the former CMO of
  Meta’s digital wallet project, Novi, has left the company to pursue
  a position at the blockchain-focused payments company Circle. This
  effect is similar to that of the wave of job switching in the early
  2010s that saw the arrival of companies such as Uber and Lyft.
  Whether or not this is just a trend in Silicon Valley or a lasting
  impact, only the future will know what is in store for the workers

* [Alex Frangi created an AI to predict heart attack risk fromo a retina scan](https://spectrum.ieee.org/retina-scan)

  A professor at the University of Leeds in England and his research assistants have been conducting research on pre-heart-attack symptoms, and how to notify the patient that they are at risk.  Data was collected from tens of thousands of individuals who had gotten recent retina scans, as well as over 5,000 cases of people who had both a retina and cardiac magnetic resnoance scan.  The data was split into 10 parts for training, and by the end the AI was able to correctly predict a heart attack 70-80% of the time.  This is a major upgrade from a doctors diagnosis for a few reasons.  First, it is much quicker.  Current methods for determining heart attack risk required blood samples as well as use of an electrocardiogram, while yhe AI only needs a retina scan, which is much faster and more patient friendly.  This is also a much cheaper option since the technology required for a retina scan is much simpler than that of CMR scans.  Retina scans will also be much more available to the general public through the use of phones.  Eventually each phone will be capable of performing a retina scan, which when mixed with this AI will give everyone the ability to test their own risk of a heart attack without requiring a doctors involvement. Finally in testing, the AI performed 10% better than any previous methods did, suggesting that this AI is capable of determining risk of a heart attack quicker, cheaper, more conveniently, and more accurately than current methods.

  This is an article about Microsoft recently purchasing the game developing company Activision Blizzard. They are responsible for many popular games such as Overwatch, Call of Duty World of Warcraft, the Diablo franchise, and many others.  In recent years the company has seen its profits dropping as their games fall out of relevancy, with no new releases gaining widespread popularity.  On January 18th, Microsoft that they would purchase Blizzard for an estimated $70 billion which is now the largest video game purchase of all time. After this sale, Microsoft will become the third biggest game developing company in the world, behind Tencent and Sony.  Currently the videogame market is extremely profitable, with an estimated 3 billion people actively engaged in at least one game.  While this new ownership would likely reignight Blizzards popularity, it is concerning how Microsoft is slowly purchasing all smaller game dev comapines. Continuing this could make it much more difficult for future game dev companies to enter the market, and further strengthen the oligopoly that top companies share today.

* [Synthetic Data Usage in AI](https://spectrum.ieee.org/synthetic-data-ai)

  This segment from IEEE talks about a company called Omniverse which is pushing for the usage of synthetic data in training AI.  Omniverse is meant to be a simulated version of reality with the minimum amount of important physics aspects implemented in order to simulate a real world setting in VR. This would allow the user to create environments to perform tests, such as on the top of a frozen mountain or middle of a desert without actually having to go to that location to gather data.  While creating "fake data" may seem like it would not be as impactful as data recorded in the real world, it would allow AI training in areas where data cannot be gathered morally or easily.  For example, Omniverse simulated a series of dangerous environments to gather data for self-driving cars.  Data was gathered on icy roads, sudden sharp turns, when animals/people run into the road, broken brakes, etc.  Most of this data would be very dangerous and immoral to gather legitimately, but training for these situations allows the self-driving cars to react approopriately to emergencies.  As the VR simulation of reality becomes more accurate data can be gathered easier and more efficiently, which could pave the way for widespread synthetic data usage in future AI.

  Earlier this month, the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved the Open App Market Act, a bill mandating that smartphone makers allow users to install unvetted applications on their devices.
  This bill is a big change from the "walled garden" distribution model of today that only allows app installation from official app stores.
  The "walled garden" model ensures higher levels of safety through basic safety screening, but cuts down on the amount of available free apps for users.
  Allowing users to install unvetted apps poses bigger security risks especially for individuals and smaller businesses that do not have the necessary security features to monitor software.
  With that said, Congress has the ability to enforce regulations that mitigate those risks, including requiring all app stores to have base levels of security, moving away from unrestricted "side-loading", and educating users on good device hygiene.

  This article discusses the prevalence of smart home tech as we progress into a digital age. The issue with
  smart home devices and appliances becoming more popular is beginning to become their lack of compatability
  with one another. This issue is soon going to be resolved with the release of matter, a language/protocol
  that allows different brands of smart home technology to communicate. Notable companies that are going to
  implement matter include Amazon, Apple, Google, Samsung, Dyson, GE, and Sonos. One issue with the release
  of matter is mass adoption is going to take some time due to the fact that not all current smart home
  devices are going to be matter compatible. Some companies have said that they may release "bridge" devices
  that will make old devices compatible with matter. Amazon has said that some Echo devices will simply need
  a firmware update but this is not necessarily the case across companies. Overall, this is an interesting
  step forward in tech as it shows that sometimes it is in big tech's best interest to work together.

  Meta's ad for a Quest 2 game. Meta's Quest 2 ad depicted an animatronic dog that gets thrown out
  after the arcade he was a part of shut down. The dog is taken from a trash compactor and brought to
  a facility where it is given Meta's VR headset, the Quest 2. The dog then virtually returns to the arcade
  that he came from and digitally reunited with his old friends. This story, while uplifting, has some darker
  undertones because not everybody has access to VR to escape tough living conditions. The ad reminds
  us that as reality becomes bleak, the virtual world may soon be the only place for people to escape and feel
  joy. The article is not all grim as it goes on to present a few weaker dystopian examples, and counter examples of other tech
  companies airing more uplifting ads.

* [Artificial intelligence and big data can help preserve wildlife](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/02/220208105313.htm)

  AI and animal ecology experts have proposed a cross-disciplinary approach to better research wildlife species in the context of preservation. AI experts can work specifically on creating new models. On the other hand, ecologists can provide AI experts with knowledge on what attributes these said models should contain and how they relate to each other. Although a large amount of data has been collected on wildlife in the past, the models are not ideal for ecological understanding. This is because these models are not customizable, have bad quality control, and have ethical issues.

* [Data breaches break record in 2021](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/record-number-of-data-breaches-reported-in-2021-new-report-says/)

  The Identity Theft Resource Center has reported that 2021 saw the highest amount of data breaches to date. The record indicates a 68% increase from 2020’s total and a 23% increase from the previous all-time high. This is a crucial topic to address, as there is no indication that data breaches will slow down in the coming years. There is a general trend in which cybercriminals are shifting towards more focused attacks instead of massive data breaches. Following 2021’s trend, it is expected that ransomware will surpass phishing as the most likely data breach in 2022. It is encouraged that all individuals practice safe cyber practices to reduce their own risk of becoming the victim of these attacks. Interestingly, the military had no data breaches in 2021, despite an increase across all other sectors.

  Virtual Reality classes are more engaging and effective at teaching than Zoom or other video based remote learning platforms. The article first starts by describing how a professor at Stanford University used VR to teach his class and how it helped his students remain more engaged with the content. VR learning is also being implemented in Longview School for gym classes and to help students learn about war and trade through the use of games like  Civilization V. Even though headsets like the Oculus Quest 2 are becoming more affordable they are still too expensive to buy a set for a whole class in many schools. Still, students who took VR classes say they remember more from the class than video based remote classes.

  Just recently Disney+ made its attempt at live streaming to the U.S, to perform this innovation on a smaller scale they chose to live stream the Oscar nominations for this year. Despite Disney already possessing live streaming services like Hulu or ESPN, this has yet to be applied to Disney+. For this event, Disney+ chose to also stream on their other streaming platforms they own such as ABC News Live, and Hulu, this helped increase the spread of viewers and lessen the burden on Disney+ for this text.

  Facebook's facial recognition technology was found to violate state's privacy protections for personal biometric data and now is discontinued. Facebook was said to be harvesting Texan's personal information witch is strictly against the laws seeing as there was not informed consent. However Meta has come forward to say the claims are without merit and they will work to fight for themselves, they argued that before the facial recognition was shut down that users were informed when those services were used.

Facebook is estimated to still generate $129 billion from ads however the ad buisness will only grow 12% as opposed to its prevous years growth of 36%. The issues with ads comes about with apples update to let users choose if they want app-folowers tracking them.

* [Mozilla and Meta working to provide info to advertisers in non-invasive ways](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/privacy-preserving-attribution-for-advertising/)

  This blog article from Mozilla talks about how they have been working with Meta to create new ways for advertisers to
  get information about users in ways that still preserve the user's privacy. They are calling it 'Privacy Preserving
  Attribution' and it is supposedly a method through which advertisers can still access metrics about how effective their
  campaigns are working without getting information about specific users. This new strategy is still being worked on but
  has been submitted for approval to the various groups that govern privacy in relation to advertising. I thought this was
  particularly interesting in light of the article that I found last week, which talked about how recent privacy policies
  from Apple (allowing users to have more power over how much advertisers can learn about their behaviour) have had an impact
  on various companies' (including Meta's) profits. This seems like a possible reaction to that or at least related, in
  that companies are trying to come up with compromises that still allow advertisers to get information about users, but
  in ways that still promote privacy for the users.

* [Computer Scientists Prove Why Bigger Neural Networks Do Better](https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientists-prove-why-bigger-neural-networks-do-better-20220210/)

  A paper presented last December as a leading conference provides a new mathematical explanation for why overparameterization unexpectedly improves the performance of neural networks.
  Overparameterization is when the number of parameters is greater than the number of training samples.
  Traditionally, it was thought that one would only ever need n parameters to fit n data points (think of the number of parameters as the number of inflections in the regression).
  However, modern neural networks are routinely scaled up far beyond that predicted requirement.
  The paper shows that overparameterization is necessary for a network to be able to generalize because smoothly fitting high-dimensional data points needs n × d parameters, where d is the dimension of the input.
  Thus, this paper brings an interesting perspective to Bender and Gebru et. al.'s work questioning the "inevitability of larger LMs."
  If it is true that models being larger is necissary for their performance as this paper suggests, the social and environmental consequences of these larger models must be weighed appropriately.

* [Intel says its new crypto chip is designed to be energy-efficient](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/13/22931836/intel-new-crypto-chip-sustainability-environment)

  Intel has designed a new chip that is much more energy efficient for cryptocurrency mining as it was designed specifically to aid and
  accelerate the types of functions that blockchain technology runs on while requiring less energy. This comes at a time when the concern over
  the amount of energy that is required to mine cryptocurrency is being realized. People and givernemnts now know the huge enviomental impact
  that cryptocurreny mining has so companies are trying to come up with solutions for this. This is where intel claims that they have mage huge
  advances by desining a chip that does one thing really well, mine crypotcurrency. According to their reporting, their chip chieved "1000x
  better performance per watt than mainstream GPUs" for mining. Intel will release more information on February 23rd at the International Solid
  State Circuits Conference.

* [Intel tries cashing in on cryptocurrency mining despite environmental problems](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/crypto/intel-tries-cashing-in-on-bitcoin-with-cryptocurrency-mining-chip/)

  Intel Corporation, plans on designing a new chip that its function is solely on bitcoin mining and other cryptocurrency operations. The company expressed that later 2022 will begin selling these kinds of chips other cryptocurrencies. Even-though the decision on manufacturing these chips will be a high financial risk for the company. With cryptocurrency NFTs booming, it alters how people own and manage their digital assets. There lie fraud and theft problems, and Intel hopes to address these drawback, and extraordinarily large energy consumption behind these operation. Mining is a computationally taxing process that records transactions onto a widely shared database called the blockchain. The first miner to solve a complex computing problem is rewarded with newly minted cryptocurrency. That means there's a strong incentive to have the most powerful, the most efficient machine Evidently, Intel hopes its chip will help with the energy consumption problem which will be a huge marketing element for the consumers and environment. Because an efficiency boost may help miners cut costs and reduce power consumption that worsens global climate crisis problems and deprives others of affordable power. However, an radical improvement in the environmental impact of mining will not be expected.

  SingularityDAO recently created an AI that determined Dynasets, or selections of specific amounts of cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin or Ethereum), which performed well regardless of the instability of the crypto market. Creating this AI involved combining AI algorithms with professional hedge fund traders to maximize profits and minimize losses. Despite the market being incredibly volatile with "Bitcoin crashing around 50 percent between November 2021 and the end of January 2022", the BitCoin DynaSet (or DynaSet with BitCoin as one of the cryptocurrencies) had "10.3% better performance over just 'hodling" (holding and buying) Bitcoin". As well as, after their collaboration with Cardano to fix issues with Ethereum trading, the Ethereum DynaSet had a "12.59% better performance over just hodling Ethereum". While the project is still in beta, it's clear that with more tweaks, that the AI may be utilized for crypto asset protection in the future.

  This article from Techcrunch discusses how Google's new post-cookies approach to advertising has been approved by the UK's competition regulator. Google plans to deprecate tracking cookies for Chrome and develop a new approach to online targeted advertising; however, this move could potentially be anti-competitive as it grants Google even more dominance over online advertising, allowing them to favor their own advertisements. This approval legally binds Google into a commitment to promote competition, and the regulatory agency will be monitoring them as they propose new ad-tracking technologies.

  This CNBC article goes over the reveal of the CIA having a data repository, which contains information collected on Americans.
  Investigation of this data collection was started by a letter sent by Senators Ron Wyden and Martin Heinrich to top CIA officials in April 2021.
  Documents revealed on limited information on a CIA program that collections financial information against CIA target list groups, which also
  snared some American citizen records. However, a CIA spokesperson has responded saying the CIA "recognizes and takes seriously"
  the protection and privacy of American's lives and their data in their pursuit of national security. While national security is a government duty, an ACLU lawyer reminds us that the "CIA conducts...these sweeping surveillance actitivites", which can go unnoticed by Congress
  and legislation. Such intelligence activities may require safeguards if they go unchecked.

  Neuralink, Elon Musk's company trying to develop implantable brain–machine interfaces, has begun testing
  its devices on animals, specifically monkeys. So far only 8 of the 23 monkeys have survived their
  expiraments, dying of brain hemmorages and needing to be euthanized after experiencing self-mutilation,
  skin lesions, and other debilatating health effects. Many animal rights activist groups have been critical
  of this news and the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) has filed a regulatory complaint
  against University of California, Davis, where the expiraments were being held. This forces one to consider
  the future of technological implants on animals, and even people, since Neuralink has begun hiring human
  test subjects, despite being unable to begin expiraments until the FDA gives them approval.

  Intel announced on February 11 that it would be launching a new chip targeted at blockchain applications, including
  cryptocurrency mining and the minting of NFTs. This is similar to a recent move made by Nvidia, who released a GPU
  specifically targeted at Ethereum mining. They have also formed a new group within its Accelerated Computing Systems and
  Graphics unit to further their involvement in the crypto space. Many have used environmental implications as an argument for
  why companies should not support crypto mining and similar activities; however, Intel has claimed that this new chip is more
  energy-efficient, and a result will consume significantly less power than alternative chips.

* [Apple Plane AirTag updates to curb unwanted tracking](https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/10/tech/airtag-safety-updates/index.html)

  In this article posted to CNN, it is announced that Apple is planning to make changes to their AirTag devices to improve the safety of people. With AirTags, there has been reports of people being tracked and stalked with the assistance of the Apple AirTags. Apple has been working with safety groups and some law enforcement agencies to improve the safety of people. One such way that they already improved safety protocols is an alert sent to people when it seems as if they are being tracked by an AirTag. This, however, isn't enough to prevent tracking, so Apple is implementing new changes to the AirTag systems this year including a louder tone sequence so that the device is easier to locate. Another change being added is a warning to users when setting up a new AirTag device that tracking others without their consent is a crime. Another workaround that Apple has to think about is the issue of Android users. Android users are now able to install an app that shows them any potential AirTags tracking them.

* [Scientists develop insect-sized flying robots with flapping wings](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/02/220202143053.htm)

  A university in Bristol has developed a new drive system for flapping wing autonomous
  robots, using a new method of electromechanical zipping that does away with the
  need for conventional motors and gears. This new advance could pave the way for
  smaller, lighter, and more effective micro flying robots for environmental monitoring,
  search and rescue, and deployment in hazardous environments. This takes inspiration from
  bees and other flying insects and successfully demonstrates a direct-drive artificial
  muscle system, called the Liquid-amplified Zipping Actuator (LAZA), that achieves wing motion
  using no rotating parts or gears. The LAZA system greatl simplifies the flapping mechanism
  enabling miniaturization of flapping robots down to teh size of insects.

* [Apple moves to stop AirTag tracking misuse](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60333771)

  Apple plans to introduce updates to their AirTag product to make it harder to misuse
  them to track people. The devices have been used to track people and when when they launched,
  Apple, introduced a siftare feature that would notify people with iPhones if a suspicious AirTag
  that doesn't belong to themm, was tracking them. Now Apple is working even harder on
  preventing misuse. When users open up their AirTags for the first time, they will get a message
  that using AirTags to track people is illegal. Apple also claims that now people will
  be alerted earlier if a suspicious AirTag is tracking them. Additionally,
  users with an iPhone 11 or newer will be able to use "percision finding" to locate
  the AirTag. They can also activate the AirTag to ring to help them find it.

  Meta recently announced that they are creating a new feature for Avatars called Personal Boundary. It was created after reports of creepy behavior and triggering experiences resembling SA. It allows avatars to create a set distance of space around them in which other avatars cannot cross. This creates more personal space for people using meta and limits unwanted interactions. Meta claims it stops others "invading your avatar's personal space"..."If someone tries to enter your Personal Boundary, the system will halt their forward movement as they reach the boundary."

  Katie Canales’ Business Insider article details how recently there
  has been a trend of high-profile executives and developers leaving
  established firms to find jobs in crypto and other decentralized
  tech ventures. A leading example of this is how the former CMO of
  Meta’s digital wallet project, Novi, has left the company to pursue
  a position at the blockchain-focused payments company Circle. This
  effect is similar to that of the wave of job switching in the early
  2010s that saw the arrival of companies such as Uber and Lyft.
  Whether or not this is just a trend in Silicon Valley or a lasting
  impact, only the future will know what is in store for the workers

  specifically to target big tech companies. These bills call for large tech
  companies such as Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft to stay below a market cap of
  $600 billion. Though these bills have not yet been passed into law, they could
  significantly impact Meta on top of the antitrust lawsuit under an already
  existing law from the Federal Trade Commission regarding the company’s alleged
  goal of maintain monopoly power through its acquisition of Instagram and
  WhatsApp. This call of a market cap by the senate is an attempt to control
  and stifle rapidly growing big tech companies.

  According to a BBC article, Amazon's Alexa told a 10-year-old girl to plug a charger into an outlet halfway,
  and then touch a penny to the exposed prongs. This incident occured while the girl and her family were
  asking Alexa for some challenges to do. The first few challenges were fun and lighthearted, but then
  Alexa said she found a challenge on the web and suggested the dangerous stunt. This apparently comes
  from a TikTok challenge, where kids would record themselves in school touching a penny to exposed prongs
  – often resulting in dangerous sparks of electricity that officials have deemed as fire hazards.
  The girl did not perform the challenge, and the mother screamed in disapproval when hearing Alexa recommend that challenge.
  Amazon has since said that they have fixed the bug.

  through ID.me because of the frustration of being verified through ID.me software.
  The facial-recognition software of video selfies with a photo ID would fail more often than succeed and users would now
  be able to verify their identity by talking to a real person instead.
  There was pushback for the long waits it took for the facial-recognition technology to work and
  how privacy advocates were against the use of facial-recognition
  because of how biometric data is kept in ID.me's database.
  Some federal agencies are questioning if their websites will continue to

  In this artical the central argument is that some software developers are using AI to help them writing code. They're discovering that AI produced codes are just as imperfect as man-made code. Reasearchers at NYU recently found that "for certain tasks where security is crucial, the code contains security flaws around 40 percent of the time." Alex Naka, a data scientist find evnethough AI may help to produce certain level of code, but it still needs human to scan through the code and fix the problem. On the other hand Hammaond Pearce, apostdocoral researcher at NYU says that "Vulnerabilities are often caused by a lack of context that a developer needs to know.” meaning that its not the AI's fault in terms of producing mistakes, it is the lack of skills of those software developers.

  This CNBC article is goes over many chip maker company's plans to increase capital spending in
  chip production. Big name companies such as TSMC and Intel have announced plans to spend $100 billion
  on production of its silicon wafers over 3 years, which mimics that of Intel's last year announcment in
  spending $20 billion on new factory plants in Arizona over 2 years. Analysts cite because of increased
  in demand in technological goods and complexity in new technology, chipmakers will increase capital expenditure
  to catch up to these new challenges. Despite these announcements, analysts cite that because of society's gluttony
  in technology goods these plans may only fullfill the "chip glut" seen once these plants and production plans are finished.
  However, with some capital response by chip makers we can hope to see the chip shortage ease, even if the road to get there is "choppy".

  In July 2020, the crucial decision from the European Union Court of Justice, Schrems II, ruled the Privacy Shield as null.
  The Privacy Sheild is a US law that allowed free transfer of personal data from EU to US companies.
  There are still other legal ways to send data EU-US, but the Schrems II ruling will have large ramifications on all American companies with users in the EU in the coming years.
  Meta is retaliating by threatening to pull its products from Europe if it is not allowed to share data with its US operations, saying stopping trans-atlantic data transfers will have devastating effects on its targeted ads.
  With Meta owning apps that have billions of users, this case will be an important precedent in the ongoing clash between big tech and governments.

The *Global News* article elaborates that the Canadian cellphone provider, Telus, provided the PHAC location and movement data to give government officials in order to gain a greater understanding of the efficacy of their COVID-19 policy. The PHAC has also stated its planning on utilizing the information it purchased outside of solely COVID-19 research. While the data itself was scrubbed in order to prevent the identification of individuals, many are still asking the question as if current data and privacy laws are strong enough and if there needs to be a policy precedent set for government bodies buying or utilizing data from private entities.

  The 5th generation of cellular networks technology is 5G and offers 10 times more bandwidth than 4G.
  The speeds of 5G can deliver from 50 megabits up to 1 GB per
  second which can download large files and stream movies very fast and easily.
  There are different band frequencies 5G can use, being that lower-frequency waves
  can extend further out, but have slower speeds and higher-frequency waves
  have the fastest speeds, but do not travel as far and cost more money which is why it is used in high concentration areas
  like stadiums and airports. Even though 5G speeds can be extremely fast,
  the more people in the area that are using 5G can carry more traffic for the bandwidth
  and cause slower connection speeds. Even though there are minor problems with 5G,
  it is still improving and has to potential to be the best cellular network technology yet.

* [Blizzard is planning a new Warcraft mobile game](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/3/22916663/activision-blizzard-warcraft-mobile-game-2022-release-date)

  is the news Blizzard is working on a new Warcraft mobile title slated for a 2022 release. According to the press release, “Blizzard is planning substantial new content for the Warcraft franchise in 2022, including [...] getting all-new mobile Warcraft content into players’ hands for the first time". The news was delivered as a press release and not a traditional call ostensibly because of its pending acquisition by Microsoft. However, I do question if the warcraft mobile is going to be elease at 2022 due to the fact that other mobile games, such as Diablo immortal and Overwatch 2 was annoced to be developed much more earlier than Warcraft Mobile. Regardless, between this sudden news of a Warcraft mobile game and the announcement of a wholly new Blizzard-developed survival game, the company is putting its best foot forward to its (pending) Microsoft overlords.

* [Nvidia ready to abandon Arm acquisition, report says](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/01/nvidia-arm-deal-is-probably-dead-report-says/)

  Ars Technica's article discusses how Nvidia's planned acquisition of the CPU-design company Arm is likely to be abandoned, since Nvidia has had trouble convincing regulators the move would not pose a risk to competition and national security. The article also states that Arm's parent company seems to be moving towards taking Arm public, seemingly implying there is not much confidence in the approval of the acquisition. Since ARM chip designs have become increasingly popular due to their power efficiency, competitors to Nvidia are concerned that their access to these designs would be limited. In addition, nation-states such as China are concerned with a key technology falling under a US company.

* [A 1-mile stretch of road is being built in Detroit that can charge electric cars as they drive -- if owners install a special receiver](https://www.businessinsider.com/public-road-detroit-to-charge-electric-cars-as-they-drive-2022-2?utm_source=reddit.com)

  Tech startup Electreon Wireless is working with Ford and DTE to build an electrified road that charges cars through inductive charging.
  Through a special receiver that costs about $3,000 to $4,000 to install, cars can be charged while driving or stopped.
  The hope is that wireless charging will aid in mass EV adoption by easing concerns related to driving range.
  Similarly, researchers at Cornell have been working on wireless charging using electric fields instead of the magnetic ones that Electreon uses, a change that might make the process cheaper and more efficient.

* [Sony is buying Bungie, the developer of Destiny and original creator of Halo](https://www.theverge.com/22910846/sony-bungie-acquisition-playstation-destiny-halo)

  This article is about the recent aquisition of games developer Bungie by Sony Interactive Entertainment for 3.6 billon dollars. This seems problematic for the playerbase of Bungies current game "Destiny 2" because Sony owning Bungie may make Destiny 2 a PlayStation exclusive game. However, Bungie says that they have an agreement to remain independant and that the game will remain multi-platform and crossplay and will not feature PlayStation exlusive content, something that has existed in Destiny 2 before. This is similar to Microsoft's aqusition of Activision Blizzard, a sign of console companies buying developers around them to support their respective platforms.

* [Sunroom is an alternative creator platform empowering women to cash in](https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/02/sunroom-creator-platform-app-women/)

  This TechCrunch article is about Sunroom, a new social media app aiming to address the
  heavy content moderation many women and non-binary content creators face on popular social
  media apps, such as Instagram by building a more open-minded platform where creators,
  only women and non-binary creators as of now, can profit off their work. As the article
  notes, Sunroom “isn’t trying to make another OnlyFans”. Instead, they hope to make a social
  media platform with limited censorship, where women and non-binary people can break down
  stigmas to profit off their creative work. The app has only 100 content creators as of its
  launch, and hopes to scale slowly to keep hands-on moderation and censorship low.

* [6 Reasons Meta Is in Trouble](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/03/technology/facebook-meta-challenges.html)

  *NY Times*'s article discusses possibilities to explain and foreshadow Meta's current and future troubles regarding the Metaverse, Facebook, and Instagram after their stock "plunged by more than 230 billion dollars". The current issues Meta faces includes hitting their user growth ceiling, changes in the data privacy from companies like Apple, and how new apps such as TikTok and Reels have affected their ways of making money off of their users. To begin with, Apple introduced an __App Tracking Transparency__ update to its operating system, "giving users the choice to ... let apps like Facebook monitor their online activities", disallowing them useful marketing data to make money off of ads, their most successful platform. Furthermore, apps such as Tiktok "present [Facebook with] a conundrum" due to the fact that to compete with Tiktok they have to focus on Reels, however while they have been very successful for bringing viewership to Instagram, they make the least amount of money per ad as users "tend to skip right past them". These newfound opponents of ad-space, users, and data privacy, along with Facebook's questionable funding of the Metaverse, have placed a dark cloud over Meta, scaring potential investors away leading to their stock plummet.

* [Apple Privacy Update Impact on Profits of other Companies](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/03/technology/apple-privacy-changes-meta.html)

  This article talks about the effect that Apple's new privacy policies have had on
  the profits of various social media companies. The new policies regard user's
  abilities to choose the extent to which advertisers can track them, and services
  such as Meta, Snap, Twitter, and others have expressed displeasure with these
  policies and have since experienced lower stock prices as a result. This is an
  interesting article because it emphasizes the conflict between ethics and profits
  in the technology industry. It also shows that Apple has an incredible amount of
  power over many other big technological services.

* [Sony Buys Bungie for $3.6 Billion](https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-sony-buys-bungie)

  Sony recently announced that it would be acquiring Bungie, the original developers of Halo and
  current developers of Destiny 2, for 3.6 billion dollars, with 1.2 billion being paid to the studio's
  employees. It is theorized that this 1.2 billion is intended to keep developers from leaving at this
  time. Some also have speculated that this is in response to Microsoft's recent announcement
  that they intend to acquire Activision Blizzard. However, that would not necessarily make sense,
  as the purchase of such a large game studio as Bungie would take more than a couple of weeks,
  and there is certainly more incentive for Sony to purchase a multi-platform game studio.
  Nevertheless, it could also be in response to other huge acquisitions by Microsoft, including that
  of Zenimax Media Inc., the parent company of Bethesda.

* [After being pushed out of Google, Timnit Gebru forms her own AI research institute: DAIR](https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/google-timnit-gebru-ai-research-dair/)

  Timnit Gebru, a leader and expert in AI ethics, has started the DAIR research institute to address ethics in AI topics 
  after being fired from Google. This institution will be independently funded, producing academic papers free of the 
  traditional pressures in academia and the overhead of corporate research. The institute has raised $3.7 million, 
  enough to keep the institution afloat for the foreseeable future. This move notes the need for research on the ethics 
  of AI separate from companies implementing AI who might influence the research and findings based on their own 
  desires.

* [Flawed data is putting people with disabilities at risk](https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/flawed-data-is-putting-people-with-disabilities-at-risk/)

  This article articulates that AI is trained to look for patterns and groups, disregarding outliers as noise, which is 
  incredibly problematic for the disabled community, whose disabilities are diverse and, in turn, require a nuanced 
  approach to understand and address. This article uses anecdotes to convey this point, addressing the case of Elaine 
  Herzberg, a woman who was hit and killed from a self-driving car when she was pushing a bicycle and the self-driving 
  vehicle failed to categorize her, leading others in the disabled community to worry about how such cars will address 
  wheelchairs and scooters. AI is trained on data, and if this data isn't fully inclusive, it lends itself to 
  problematic AI which threatens to exclude minority groups and overlook important societal issues.

* [This Program Can Give AI a Sense of Ethics - Sometimes](https://www.wired.com/story/program-give-ai-ethics-sometimes/)

  Artificial intelligence has had incredible success in problem-solving, but it still fails to have actual 
  comprehension, leaving it incapable of understand human values and deciphering right from wrong. A University of 
  Washington and Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence program, Delphi, has aimed to solve this problem and be an 
  AI that can understand human values. It has had lots of success, matching human-answered ethics questions 92 percent 
  of the time, which beats the previous record of 80 percent by a long shot. However, this occasional mismatching has 
  still left lots of room for misjudgements. In part, the training data may be biased, leading to some radical biases 
  and aggressions seen in the program outputs. These poor judgements have led to reactions from other ethics researchers, 
  arguing that these outputs affirm that AI should not be given authority to make ethical judgements.

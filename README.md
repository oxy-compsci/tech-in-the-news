* [Amazon to Start Charging Sellers 5% 'Fuel and Inflation' Fee, Reports Say](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/amazon-to-start-charging-sellers-5-fuel-and-inflation-fee-reports-say/)

Amazon is going to charge a 5% "fuel and inflation surcharge" on third-party merchants who use its services starting April 28th. It is going to be a fee that applies to all products and analysts predict many sellers will add this fee to their products to their customers. I think that Amazon is being stingy with another fee because of how much revenue they make on a daily basis with the number of users they have. It affects the consumers because prices are already increasing with inflation in the US and products will be more costly on the Amazon website. This impacts society because of how Amazon has so many subscribers for its service and how popular the app is. With increased prices, it can affect how customers feel negatively about the service because of how much revenue Amazon makes and might lose users because of already increasing inflation.


* [Sunroom is an alternative creator platform empowering women to cash in](https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/02/sunroom-creator-platform-app-women/)

  This TechCrunch article is about Sunroom, a new social media app aiming to address the
  heavy content moderation many women and non-binary content creators face on popular social
  media apps, such as Instagram by building a more open-minded platform where creators,
  only women and non-binary creators as of now, can profit off their work. As the article
  notes, Sunroom “isn’t trying to make another OnlyFans”. Instead, they hope to make a social
  media platform with limited censorship, where women and non-binary people can break down
  stigmas to profit off their creative work. The app has only 100 content creators as of its
  launch, and hopes to scale slowly to keep hands-on moderation and censorship low.

* [6 Reasons Meta Is in Trouble](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/03/technology/facebook-meta-challenges.html)

  *NY Times*'s article discusses possibilities to explain and foreshadow Meta's current and future troubles regarding the Metaverse, Facebook, and Instagram after their stock "plunged by more than 230 billion dollars". The current issues Meta faces includes hitting their user growth ceiling, changes in the data privacy from companies like Apple, and how new apps such as TikTok and Reels have affected their ways of making money off of their users. To begin with, Apple introduced an __App Tracking Transparency__ update to its operating system, "giving users the choice to ... let apps like Facebook monitor their online activities", disallowing them useful marketing data to make money off of ads, their most successful platform. Furthermore, apps such as Tiktok "present [Facebook with] a conundrum" due to the fact that to compete with Tiktok they have to focus on Reels, however while they have been very successful for bringing viewership to Instagram, they make the least amount of money per ad as users "tend to skip right past them". These newfound opponents of ad-space, users, and data privacy, along with Facebook's questionable funding of the Metaverse, have placed a dark cloud over Meta, scaring potential investors away leading to their stock plummet. 

* [Apple Privacy Update Impact on Profits of other Companies](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/03/technology/apple-privacy-changes-meta.html)

  This article talks about the effect that Apple's new privacy policies have had on
  the profits of various social media companies. The new policies regard user's
  abilities to choose the extent to which advertisers can track them, and services
  such as Meta, Snap, Twitter, and others have expressed displeasure with these
  policies and have since experienced lower stock prices as a result. This is an
  interesting article because it emphasizes the conflict between ethics and profits
  in the technology industry. It also shows that Apple has an incredible amount of
  power over many other big technological services. 

* [Sony Buys Bungie for $3.6 Billion](https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-sony-buys-bungie)

  Sony recently announced that it would be acquiring Bungie, the original developers of Halo and
  current developers of Destiny 2, for 3.6 billion dollars, with 1.2 billion being paid to the studio's
  employees. It is theorized that this 1.2 billion is intended to keep developers from leaving at this
  time. Some also have speculated that this is in response to Microsoft's recent announcement
  that they intend to acquire Activision Blizzard. However, that would not necessarily make sense,
  as the purchase of such a large game studio as Bungie would take more than a couple of weeks,
  and there is certainly more incentive for Sony to purchase a multi-platform game studio.
  Nevertheless, it could also be in response to other huge acquisitions by Microsoft, including that
  of Zenimax Media Inc., the parent company of Bethesda.

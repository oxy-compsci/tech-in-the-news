Google wants to do more to help people get the information they need, and it claims that new AI approaches that better comprehend the complexity of language are assisting individuals crisist. Google's search engine is using machine learning. MUM will be able to detect search queries relating to severe personal situations that previous techniques were unable to detect. MUM may respond to inquiries such as "most prevalent methods of suicide completion" and "Sydney suicide hot locations." According to the company, it has "reduced unanticipated stunning results" by 30% year on year. Google does not reveal how many "startling results" its consumers encounter on a daily basis. In my opinion, Google using Ai to better detect searches ffrom people in crisis can help thouse people in several ways and present a good impact othe society. As we know, that when internet people ecounters crisis, their first reactionis either ask thier friends, parents, or search online In additon to the recent increase in depression, google using AI may help the user to realize thier issues and provide better solution faster.

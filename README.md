* [Chip giants are ramping up spending by the billions as semiconductor demand booms](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/04/tsmc-intel-ramp-up-spending-as-semiconductor-demand-booms.html)

  This CNBC article is goes over many chip maker company's plans to increase capital spending in 
  chip production. Big name companies such as TSMC and Intel have announced plans to spend $100 billion 
  on production of its silicon wafers over 3 years, which mimics that of Intel's last year announcment in 
  spending $20 billion on new factory plants in Arizona over 2 years. Analysts cite because of increased 
  in demand in technological goods and complexity in new technology, chipmakers will increase capital expenditure 
  to catch up to these new challenges. Despite these announcements, analysts cite that because of society's gluttony 
  in technology goods these plans may only fullfill the "chip glut" seen once these plants and production plans are finished. 
  However, with some capital response by chip makers we can hope to see the chip shortage ease, even if the road to get there is "choppy".

* [DeepMind says its new AI coding engine is as good as an average human programmer](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/2/22914085/alphacode-ai-coding-program-automatic-deepmind-codeforce)

  The company DeepMind created an AI system named AlphaCode that can autonomously solve coding problems at the same level as humans. It was tested on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com), a platform that provides coding problems and ranks its users, and was ranked top 28% of users in the past 6 months. However, these AI coding systems will not replace human programmers anytime soon due to their inherit bugs and security issues. For now, they'll simply be used a tool by human programmers.

* [Apple fined again over Dutch dating app payments order](https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/07/apple-third-dutch-antitrust-fine/)

  This TechCrunch article is about Apple's "antitrust standoff in the Netherlands". Apple has
  an outstanding 15M euros from this impasse over Apple's disallowing local dating apps to use
  third party payment providers, instead requiring such apps to use Apple's own payment
  infrastructure which Apple gets commissions from. Apple has been fighting the order, but just
  last month agreed to let apps use other payment providers. However, the Dutch government is
  still fined Apple over frustration with their general failure to comply.

* [Coinbase and Crypto Taxes](https://bgr.com/tech/coinbase-lets-you-receive-your-tax-refund-as-cryptocurrency/)

  Coinbase haș added onto their service so that users can have an easier time filing their
  taxes on their cryptocurrency. Taxpayers in the U.S. can see a personalized summary of
  their taxable activity: sales, conversions, payments, and income. They are even offering
  tax services for those who perform transactions without the service via CoinTracker. Furthermore,
  customers can now get their tax return deposited directly into their Coinbase account, as
  long as the customer has filed with TurboTax. This article makes readers think about how
  cryptocurrency continues to permeate society - normalizing the practice of owning and trading
  cryptocurrency and increasing the accessibility of each. It is also interesting to think
  about how a digital, decentralized medium of exchange exists in conjunction to something
  as essential to our centralized government as taxes.

* [New super-conductors could take data beyond zeroes and ones](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/02/220201161056.htm)

  There is potential for encoding data in new ways due to recent research in the field of spintronics. This research, conducted by a team at Duke University and Weizmann Institute resulted in the development of a conductor system that does not require cold temperatures in order to control the spinning of electrons and sending them over long distances. This development can potentially allow large magnitude spin currents to be created at room temperature, which may change how our current devices, such as smartphones, look.

* [Meta threatens to pull Facebook and Instagram from Europe if it can't target ads](https://itwire.com/listed-tech/meta-threatens-to-pull-facebook-and-instagram-from-europe-if-it-can-t-target-ads.html)

  In July 2020, the crucial decision from the European Union Court of Justice, Schrems II, ruled the Privacy Shield as null.
  The Privacy Sheild is a US law that allowed free transfer of personal data from EU to US companies.
  There are still other legal ways to send data EU-US, but the Schrems II ruling will have large ramifications on all American companies with users in the EU in the coming years.
  Meta is retaliating by threatening to pull its products from Europe if it is not allowed to share data with its US operations, saying stopping trans-atlantic data transfers will have devastating effects on its targeted ads.
  With Meta owning apps that have billions of users, this case will be an important precedent in the ongoing clash between big tech and governments.

* [Canada’s privacy watchdog probing health officials’ use of cellphone location data](https://globalnews.ca/news/8503895/watchdog-probing-officials-cell-location-data/)

  The Public Health Agency of Canada, or PHAC, has recently come under fire after it was revealed the government agency had been buying cellphone data from telecom companies in order to track its citizens. The *Global News* article elaborates that the Canadian cellphone provider, Telus, provided the PHAC location and movement data to give government officials in order to gain a greater understanding of the efficacy of their COVID-19 policy. The PHAC has also stated its planning on utilizing the information it purchased outside of solely COVID-19 research. While the data itself was scrubbed in order to prevent the identification of individuals, many are still asking the question as if current data and privacy laws are strong enough and if there needs to be a policy precedent set for government bodies buying or utilizing data from private entities.

* [The IRS Should Stop Using Facial Recognition](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/irs-should-stop-using-facial-recognition/621386/)

  ID.me's propietary facial recognition technology is not immune to bias despite their efforts to
  market it as such. The company specifically defines their services as outside the realm of "facial
  recognition" through a narrow definition in a 2022 white paper. They explicitly define two types of facial
  recognition: one-to-one, and one-to-many facial recognition and the company asserts that
  there are "significant benefits" to using 'one-to-one' facial recognition.  However, the company fails to
  mention the racial biases of one-to-one technology that cause both false positives and false
  negatives. Despite these overwhelming issues, "27 states, multiple federal agencies, and over 500
  name brand retailers" continue to use ID.me's techology further supporting the company's false claims.

* [What Is 5G? An Electrical Engineer Explains the Technology](https://scitechdaily.com/what-is-5g-an-electrical-engineer-explains-the-technology/)

  The 5th generation of cellular networks technology is 5G and offers 10 times more bandwidth than 4G.
  The speeds of 5G can deliver from 50 megabits up to 1 GB per
  second which can download large files and stream movies very fast and easily.
  There are different band frequencies 5G can use, being that lower-frequency waves
  can extend further out, but have slower speeds and higher-frequency waves
  have the fastest speeds, but do not travel as far and cost more money which is why it is used in high concentration areas
  like stadiums and airports. Even though 5G speeds can be extremely fast,
  the more people in the area that are using 5G can carry more traffic for the bandwidth
  and cause slower connection speeds. Even though there are minor problems with 5G,
  it is still improving and has to potential to be the best cellular network technology yet.

* [Blizzard is planning a new Warcraft mobile game](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/3/22916663/activision-blizzard-warcraft-mobile-game-2022-release-date)

  is the news Blizzard is working on a new Warcraft mobile title slated for a 2022 release. According to the press release, “Blizzard is planning substantial new content for the Warcraft franchise in 2022, including [...] getting all-new mobile Warcraft content into players’ hands for the first time". The news was delivered as a press release and not a traditional call ostensibly because of its pending acquisition by Microsoft. However, I do question if the warcraft mobile is going to be elease at 2022 due to the fact that other mobile games, such as Diablo immortal and Overwatch 2 was annoced to be developed much more earlier than Warcraft Mobile. Regardless, between this sudden news of a Warcraft mobile game and the announcement of a wholly new Blizzard-developed survival game, the company is putting its best foot forward to its (pending) Microsoft overlords.

* [Nvidia ready to abandon Arm acquisition, report says](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/01/nvidia-arm-deal-is-probably-dead-report-says/)

  Ars Technica's article discusses how Nvidia's planned acquisition of the CPU-design company Arm is likely to be abandoned, since Nvidia has had trouble convincing regulators the move would not pose a risk to competition and national security. The article also states that Arm's parent company seems to be moving towards taking Arm public, seemingly implying there is not much confidence in the approval of the acquisition. Since ARM chip designs have become increasingly popular due to their power efficiency, competitors to Nvidia are concerned that their access to these designs would be limited. In addition, nation-states such as China are concerned with a key technology falling under a US company.

* [A 1-mile stretch of road is being built in Detroit that can charge electric cars as they drive -- if owners install a special receiver](https://www.businessinsider.com/public-road-detroit-to-charge-electric-cars-as-they-drive-2022-2?utm_source=reddit.com)

  Tech startup Electreon Wireless is working with Ford and DTE to build an electrified road that charges cars through inductive charging.
  Through a special receiver that costs about $3,000 to $4,000 to install, cars can be charged while driving or stopped.
  The hope is that wireless charging will aid in mass EV adoption by easing concerns related to driving range.
  Similarly, researchers at Cornell have been working on wireless charging using electric fields instead of the magnetic ones that Electreon uses, a change that might make the process cheaper and more efficient.

* [Sony is buying Bungie, the developer of Destiny and original creator of Halo](https://www.theverge.com/22910846/sony-bungie-acquisition-playstation-destiny-halo)

  This article is about the recent aquisition of games developer Bungie by Sony Interactive Entertainment for 3.6 billon dollars. This seems problematic for the playerbase of Bungies current game "Destiny 2" because Sony owning Bungie may make Destiny 2 a PlayStation exclusive game. However, Bungie says that they have an agreement to remain independant and that the game will remain multi-platform and crossplay and will not feature PlayStation exlusive content, something that has existed in Destiny 2 before. This is similar to Microsoft's aqusition of Activision Blizzard, a sign of console companies buying developers around them to support their respective platforms.

* [Sunroom is an alternative creator platform empowering women to cash in](https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/02/sunroom-creator-platform-app-women/)

  This TechCrunch article is about Sunroom, a new social media app aiming to address the
  heavy content moderation many women and non-binary content creators face on popular social
  media apps, such as Instagram by building a more open-minded platform where creators,
  only women and non-binary creators as of now, can profit off their work. As the article
  notes, Sunroom “isn’t trying to make another OnlyFans”. Instead, they hope to make a social
  media platform with limited censorship, where women and non-binary people can break down
  stigmas to profit off their creative work. The app has only 100 content creators as of its
  launch, and hopes to scale slowly to keep hands-on moderation and censorship low.

* [6 Reasons Meta Is in Trouble](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/03/technology/facebook-meta-challenges.html)

  *NY Times*'s article discusses possibilities to explain and foreshadow Meta's current and future troubles regarding the Metaverse, Facebook, and Instagram after their stock "plunged by more than 230 billion dollars". The current issues Meta faces includes hitting their user growth ceiling, changes in the data privacy from companies like Apple, and how new apps such as TikTok and Reels have affected their ways of making money off of their users. To begin with, Apple introduced an __App Tracking Transparency__ update to its operating system, "giving users the choice to ... let apps like Facebook monitor their online activities", disallowing them useful marketing data to make money off of ads, their most successful platform. Furthermore, apps such as Tiktok "present [Facebook with] a conundrum" due to the fact that to compete with Tiktok they have to focus on Reels, however while they have been very successful for bringing viewership to Instagram, they make the least amount of money per ad as users "tend to skip right past them". These newfound opponents of ad-space, users, and data privacy, along with Facebook's questionable funding of the Metaverse, have placed a dark cloud over Meta, scaring potential investors away leading to their stock plummet.

* [Apple Privacy Update Impact on Profits of other Companies](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/03/technology/apple-privacy-changes-meta.html)

  This article talks about the effect that Apple's new privacy policies have had on
  the profits of various social media companies. The new policies regard user's
  abilities to choose the extent to which advertisers can track them, and services
  such as Meta, Snap, Twitter, and others have expressed displeasure with these
  policies and have since experienced lower stock prices as a result. This is an
  interesting article because it emphasizes the conflict between ethics and profits
  in the technology industry. It also shows that Apple has an incredible amount of
  power over many other big technological services.

* [Sony Buys Bungie for $3.6 Billion](https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-sony-buys-bungie)

  Sony recently announced that it would be acquiring Bungie, the original developers of Halo and
  current developers of Destiny 2, for 3.6 billion dollars, with 1.2 billion being paid to the studio's
  employees. It is theorized that this 1.2 billion is intended to keep developers from leaving at this
  time. Some also have speculated that this is in response to Microsoft's recent announcement
  that they intend to acquire Activision Blizzard. However, that would not necessarily make sense,
  as the purchase of such a large game studio as Bungie would take more than a couple of weeks,
  and there is certainly more incentive for Sony to purchase a multi-platform game studio.
  Nevertheless, it could also be in response to other huge acquisitions by Microsoft, including that
  of Zenimax Media Inc., the parent company of Bethesda.

[Computer Scientists Prove Why Bigger Neural Networks Do Better](https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientists-prove-why-bigger-neural-networks-do-better-20220210/)

 The article suggest that the bigger neural networks is, the better they perform. In "A Universal Law of Robustness via Isoperimetry", a paper presented in December at NeurIPS, a leading conference, Sébastien Bubeck of Microsoft Research and Mark Sellke of Stanford University, the researcher proof that  overparameterization is necessary for a network to be robust. They do it by figuring out how many parameters are needed to fit data points with a curve that has a mathematical property equivalent to robustness: smoothness. The researcher showed that smoothly fitting high-dimensional data points requires not just n parameters, but n × d parameters, where d is the dimension of the input (for example, 784 for a 784-pixel image). So if a network need to robustly memorize its training data, overparameterization is not just helpful — it’s mandatory.

* [Mozilla and Meta working to provide info to advertisers in non-invasive ways](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/privacy-preserving-attribution-for-advertising/)

  This blog article from Mozilla talks about how they have been working with Meta to create new ways for advertisers to
  get information about users in ways that still preserve the user's privacy. They are calling it 'Privacy Preserving
  Attribution' and it is supposedly a method through which advertisers can still access metrics about how effective their
  campaigns are working without getting information about specific users. This new strategy is still being worked on but
  has been submitted for approval to the various groups that govern privacy in relation to advertising. I thought this was
  particularly interesting in light of the article that I found last week, which talked about how recent privacy policies
  from Apple (allowing users to have more power over how much advertisers can learn about their behaviour) have had an impact
  on various companies' (including Meta's) profits. This seems like a possible reaction to that or at least related, in
  that companies are trying to come up with compromises that still allow advertisers to get information about users, but
  in ways that still promote privacy for the users.

* [Fusion race kicked into high gear by smart tech](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-60319398)

  An American company is striving to make fusion economically viable with the help of Google's machine learning "expertise". What once used to take two months, with the help of machine learning, takes a fraction of an afternoon. The article states that Google's contribution has could accelerate from the company's long-term schedule, which could potentially lead to a commercial fusion test by 2030. Along with this, TAE is launching technology with the intention of advancing cancer treatment.

* [Computer Scientists Prove Why Bigger Neural Networks Do Better](https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientists-prove-why-bigger-neural-networks-do-better-20220210/)

  A paper presented last December as a leading conference provides a new mathematical explanation for why overparameterization unexpectedly improves the performance of neural networks.
  Overparameterization is when the number of parameters is greater than the number of training samples.
  Traditionally, it was thought that one would only ever need n parameters to fit n data points (think of the number of parameters as the number of inflections in the regression).
  However, modern neural networks are routinely scaled up far beyond that predicted requirement.
  The paper shows that overparameterization is necessary for a network to be able to generalize because smoothly fitting high-dimensional data points needs n × d parameters, where d is the dimension of the input.
  Thus, this paper brings an interesting perspective to Bender and Gebru et. al.'s work questioning the "inevitability of larger LMs."
  If it is true that models being larger is necissary for their performance as this paper suggests, the social and environmental consequences of these larger models must be weighed appropriately.

* [Intel says its new crypto chip is designed to be energy-efficient](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/13/22931836/intel-new-crypto-chip-sustainability-environment)

  Intel has designed a new chip that is much more energy efficient for cryptocurrency mining as it was designed specifically to aid and
  accelerate the types of functions that blockchain technology runs on while requiring less energy. This comes at a time when the concern over
  the amount of energy that is required to mine cryptocurrency is being realized. People and givernemnts now know the huge enviomental impact
  that cryptocurreny mining has so companies are trying to come up with solutions for this. This is where intel claims that they have mage huge
  advances by desining a chip that does one thing really well, mine crypotcurrency. According to their reporting, their chip chieved "1000x
  better performance per watt than mainstream GPUs" for mining. Intel will release more information on February 23rd at the International Solid
  State Circuits Conference.

* [Intel tries cashing in on cryptocurrency mining despite environmental problems](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/crypto/intel-tries-cashing-in-on-bitcoin-with-cryptocurrency-mining-chip/)

  Intel Corporation, plans on designing a new chip that its function is solely on bitcoin mining and other cryptocurrency operations. The company expressed that later 2022 will begin selling these kinds of chips other cryptocurrencies. Even-though the decision on manufacturing these chips will be a high financial risk for the company. With cryptocurrency NFTs booming, it alters how people own and manage their digital assets. There lie fraud and theft problems, and Intel hopes to address these drawback, and extraordinarily large energy consumption behind these operation. Mining is a computationally taxing process that records transactions onto a widely shared database called the blockchain. The first miner to solve a complex computing problem is rewarded with newly minted cryptocurrency. That means there's a strong incentive to have the most powerful, the most efficient machine Evidently, Intel hopes its chip will help with the energy consumption problem which will be a huge marketing element for the consumers and environment. Because an efficiency boost may help miners cut costs and reduce power consumption that worsens global climate crisis problems and deprives others of affordable power. However, an radical improvement in the environmental impact of mining will not be expected.

* [SingularityDAO’s AI-powered ‘DynaSets’ outperform the crypto market](https://artificialintelligence-news.com/2022/02/11/singularitydaos-ai-powered-dynasets-outperform-the-crypto-market/)

  SingularityDAO recently created an AI that determined Dynasets, or selections of specific amounts of cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin or Ethereum), which performed well regardless of the instability of the crypto market. Creating this AI involved combining AI algorithms with professional hedge fund traders to maximize profits and minimize losses. Despite the market being incredibly volatile with "Bitcoin crashing around 50 percent between November 2021 and the end of January 2022", the BitCoin DynaSet (or DynaSet with BitCoin as one of the cryptocurrencies) had "10.3% better performance over just 'hodling" (holding and buying) Bitcoin". As well as, after their collaboration with Cardano to fix issues with Ethereum trading, the Ethereum DynaSet had a "12.59% better performance over just hodling Ethereum". While the project is still in beta, it's clear that with more tweaks, that the AI may be utilized for crypto asset protection in the future.

* [UK’s CMA accepts Google’s post-cookie pledges, will ‘closely monitor’ Privacy Sandbox plan](https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/11/uks-cma-accepts-googles-post-cookie-pledges-will-closely-monitor-privacy-sandbox-plan/)

  This article from Techcrunch discusses how Google's new post-cookies approach to advertising has been approved by the UK's competition regulator. Google plans to deprecate tracking cookies for Chrome and develop a new approach to online targeted advertising; however, this move could potentially be anti-competitive as it grants Google even more dominance over online advertising, allowing them to favor their own advertisements. This approval legally binds Google into a commitment to promote competition, and the regulatory agency will be monitoring them as they propose new ad-tracking technologies.

* [CIA is secretly collecting bulk data pertaining to Americans, senators say](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/cia-secretly-collecting-bulk-data-pertaining-americans-senators-say-rcna15830)

  This CNBC article goes over the reveal of the CIA having a data repository, which contains information collected on Americans.
  Investigation of this data collection was started by a letter sent by Senators Ron Wyden and Martin Heinrich to top CIA officials in April 2021.
  Documents revealed on limited information on a CIA program that collections financial information against CIA target list groups, which also
  snared some American citizen records. However, a CIA spokesperson has responded saying the CIA "recognizes and takes seriously"
  the protection and privacy of American's lives and their data in their pursuit of national security. While national security is a government duty, an ACLU lawyer reminds us that the "CIA conducts...these sweeping surveillance actitivites", which can go unnoticed by Congress
  and legislation. Such intelligence activities may require safeguards if they go unchecked.

* [Neuralink Killing Primate Test Subjects](https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/ny-doctors-accuse-elon-musk-neuralink-extereme-suffering-monkeys-pcrm-20220212-d3bqz7azyfbx5ldljhovfsjdce-story.html)

  Neuralink, Elon Musk's company trying to develop implantable brain–machine interfaces, has begun testing
  its devices on animals, specifically monkeys. So far only 8 of the 23 monkeys have survived their
  expiraments, dying of brain hemmorages and needing to be euthanized after experiencing self-mutilation,
  skin lesions, and other debilatating health effects. Many animal rights activist groups have been critical
  of this news and the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) has filed a regulatory complaint
  against University of California, Davis, where the expiraments were being held. This forces one to consider
  the future of technological implants on animals, and even people, since Neuralink has begun hiring human
  test subjects, despite being unable to begin expiraments until the FDA gives them approval.

* [Intel launches blockchain chip to tap crypto boom](https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-launches-blockchain-chip-tap-crypto-boom-2022-02-11/)

  Intel announced on February 11 that it would be launching a new chip targeted at blockchain applications, including
  cryptocurrency mining and the minting of NFTs. This is similar to a recent move made by Nvidia, who released a GPU
  specifically targeted at Ethereum mining. They have also formed a new group within its Accelerated Computing Systems and
  Graphics unit to further their involvement in the crypto space. Many have used environmental implications as an argument for
  why companies should not support crypto mining and similar activities; however, Intel has claimed that this new chip is more
  energy-efficient, and a result will consume significantly less power than alternative chips.

* [Apple Plane AirTag updates to curb unwanted tracking](https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/10/tech/airtag-safety-updates/index.html)

  In this article posted to CNN, it is announced that Apple is planning to make changes to their AirTag devices to improve the safety of people. With AirTags, there has been reports of people being tracked and stalked with the assistance of the Apple AirTags. Apple has been working with safety groups and some law enforcement agencies to improve the safety of people. One such way that they already improved safety protocols is an alert sent to people when it seems as if they are being tracked by an AirTag. This, however, isn't enough to prevent tracking, so Apple is implementing new changes to the AirTag systems this year including a louder tone sequence so that the device is easier to locate. Another change being added is a warning to users when setting up a new AirTag device that tracking others without their consent is a crime. Another workaround that Apple has to think about is the issue of Android users. Android users are now able to install an app that shows them any potential AirTags tracking them.

* [Scientists develop insect-sized flying robots with flapping wings](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/02/220202143053.htm)

  A university in Bristol has developed a new drive system for flapping wing autonomous
  robots, using a new method of electromechanical zipping that does away with the
  need for conventional motors and gears. This new advance could pave the way for
  smaller, lighter, and more effective micro flying robots for environmental monitoring,
  search and rescue, and deployment in hazardous environments. This takes inspiration from
  bees and other flying insects and successfully demonstrates a direct-drive artificial
  muscle system, called the Liquid-amplified Zipping Actuator (LAZA), that achieves wing motion
  using no rotating parts or gears. The LAZA system greatl simplifies the flapping mechanism
  enabling miniaturization of flapping robots down to teh size of insects.

* [Apple moves to stop AirTag tracking misuse](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60333771)

  Apple plans to introduce updates to their AirTag product to make it harder to misuse
  them to track people. The devices have been used to track people and when when they launched,
  Apple, introduced a siftare feature that would notify people with iPhones if a suspicious AirTag
  that doesn't belong to themm, was tracking them. Now Apple is working even harder on
  preventing misuse. When users open up their AirTags for the first time, they will get a message
  that using AirTags to track people is illegal. Apple also claims that now people will
  be alerted earlier if a suspicious AirTag is tracking them. Additionally,
  users with an iPhone 11 or newer will be able to use "percision finding" to locate
  the AirTag. They can also activate the AirTag to ring to help them find it.

* [Meta Adds New Feature for Avatars](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60247542)

  Meta recently announced that they are creating a new feature for Avatars called Personal Boundary. It was created after reports of creepy behavior and triggering experiences resembling SA. It allows avatars to create a set distance of space around them in which other avatars cannot cross. This creates more personal space for people using meta and limits unwanted interactions. Meta claims it stops others "invading your avatar's personal space"..."If someone tries to enter your Personal Boundary, the system will halt their forward movement as they reach the boundary."

* [Zoox robotaxis are already mingling with the public on semi-private test courses](https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/10/zoox-robotaxis-are-already-mingling-with-the-public-on-semi-private-test-courses/)

  Amazon subsidiary, Zoox has begun testing out dozens of custom-built robotaxis on various campus-like environments across California.
  The cube-shaped robotaxis, unveiled in December 2020, can drive bidirectionally, with four-wheel steering, and are capable of transporting four people at up to 75 mph.
  While the company has no planned date for public release, a spokesperson for the company believes its "really not that far away."
  Concurrently, Zoox has also equipped several Toyota Highlanders with their autonomous driving system, testing them out in San Francisco, Las Vegas, Seattle, and Foster City with human safety drivers behind the wheel monitoring the vehicles.

* [Silicon Valley is no longer the edgy tech frontier as workers flee Google and Amazon for crypto and Web3 startups, recruiters say]( https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-workers-leaving-for-crypto-web3-startups-silicon-valley-recruiters-2022-2)

  Katie Canales’ Business Insider article details how recently there
  has been a trend of high-profile executives and developers leaving
  established firms to find jobs in crypto and other decentralized
  tech ventures. A leading example of this is how the former CMO of
  Meta’s digital wallet project, Novi, has left the company to pursue
  a position at the blockchain-focused payments company Circle. This
  effect is similar to that of the wave of job switching in the early
  2010s that saw the arrival of companies such as Uber and Lyft.
  Whether or not this is just a trend in Silicon Valley or a lasting
  impact, only the future will know what is in store for the workers
  who leave for crypto and Web3 startups.

* [Facebook market cap falls below $600 billion — which could actually help it dodge new antitrust scrutiny](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/08/facebook-market-cap-under-600-billion-threshold-for-antitrust-bills.html)

  Lauren Feiner's article touches on the recent events regarding the renamed
  company Meta and a newly released package of competition bills designed
  specifically to target big tech companies. These bills call for large tech
  companies such as Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft to stay below a market cap of
  $600 billion. Though these bills have not yet been passed into law, they could
  significantly impact Meta on top of the antitrust lawsuit under an already
  existing law from the Federal Trade Commission regarding the company’s alleged
  goal of maintain monopoly power through its acquisition of Instagram and
  WhatsApp. This call of a market cap by the senate is an attempt to control
  and stifle rapidly growing big tech companies.

* [Alexa tells 10-year-old girl to touch live plug with penny](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59810383)

  According to a BBC article, Amazon's Alexa told a 10-year-old girl to plug a charger into an outlet halfway,
  and then touch a penny to the exposed prongs. This incident occured while the girl and her family were
  asking Alexa for some challenges to do. The first few challenges were fun and lighthearted, but then
  Alexa said she found a challenge on the web and suggested the dangerous stunt. This apparently comes
  from a TikTok challenge, where kids would record themselves in school touching a penny to exposed prongs
  – often resulting in dangerous sparks of electricity that officials have deemed as fire hazards.
  The girl did not perform the challenge, and the mother screamed in disapproval when hearing Alexa recommend that challenge.
  Amazon has since said that they have fixed the bug.

* [After face-recognition backlash, ID.me says government agencies will get more verification options](https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/08/tech/idme-facial-recognition-bypass/index.html)

  The IRS stopped their plan of letting users get verified by facial-recognition
  through ID.me because of the frustration of being verified through ID.me software.
  The facial-recognition software of video selfies with a photo ID would fail more often than succeed and users would now
  be able to verify their identity by talking to a real person instead.
  There was pushback for the long waits it took for the facial-recognition technology to work and
  how privacy advocates were against the use of facial-recognition
  because of how biometric data is kept in ID.me's database.
  Some federal agencies are questioning if their websites will continue to
  use ID.me for security reasons in the future because of privacy concerns.

* [AI Can Write Code Like Humans—Bugs and All](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-write-code-like-humans-bugs/)

  In this artical the central argument is that some software developers are using AI to help them writing code. They're discovering that AI produced codes are just as imperfect as man-made code. Reasearchers at NYU recently found that "for certain tasks where security is crucial, the code contains security flaws around 40 percent of the time." Alex Naka, a data scientist find evnethough AI may help to produce certain level of code, but it still needs human to scan through the code and fix the problem. On the other hand Hammaond Pearce, apostdocoral researcher at NYU says that "Vulnerabilities are often caused by a lack of context that a developer needs to know.” meaning that its not the AI's fault in terms of producing mistakes, it is the lack of skills of those software developers.

* [Walmart is quietly preparing to enter the metaverse](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2022/01/16/walmart-is-quietly-preparing-to-enter-the-metaverse.html)

  Walmart appears to be planning its own collection of NFTs and cryptocurrency. Recently, they have been filing trademarks which lead
  people to speculate that they will enter the market of virtual products. A separate filing specified that Walmart will be presenting
  customers with the NFTs and virtual currency. This news puts Walmart among a slew of other big companies that have declared their
  entrance into the Metaverse. Companies such as Nike, Gap, Under Armour, Adidas, and Urban Outfitters have already filed trademark
  applications or made NFT debuts within the last couple of months.

* [Your iPhone may soon be able accept contactless payments directly](https://www.techradar.com/news/apple-is-taking-on-square-with-a-new-contactless-payments-system)

  Apple is looking into making the iPhone a point of sale system by adding Square like payments into
  the iPhone. Apple paid the Canadian company Mobeewave, a company known for working on
  technology to accept payment via smartphones, roughly 100 million dollars. It is likely that the
  iPhones pre-existing near field communication (NFC) tech that is already used for apple pay
  will be used to make these payments possible. There already are companies like Square, recently
  renamed to Block, that offer a card reader attachment for the iPhone but Apple will be negating the
  need to have any device other than the iPhone itself. The article discusses whether or not Apple would
  allow other companies such as Square to use the new tech and as of now it is unknown. The feature could
  be released as soon as a couple of months from now as part of iOS 15.3.

* [Chip giants are ramping up spending by the billions as semiconductor demand booms](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/04/tsmc-intel-ramp-up-spending-as-semiconductor-demand-booms.html)

  This CNBC article is goes over many chip maker company's plans to increase capital spending in
  chip production. Big name companies such as TSMC and Intel have announced plans to spend $100 billion
  on production of its silicon wafers over 3 years, which mimics that of Intel's last year announcment in
  spending $20 billion on new factory plants in Arizona over 2 years. Analysts cite because of increased
  in demand in technological goods and complexity in new technology, chipmakers will increase capital expenditure
  to catch up to these new challenges. Despite these announcements, analysts cite that because of society's gluttony
  in technology goods these plans may only fullfill the "chip glut" seen once these plants and production plans are finished.
  However, with some capital response by chip makers we can hope to see the chip shortage ease, even if the road to get there is "choppy".

* [DeepMind says its new AI coding engine is as good as an average human programmer](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/2/22914085/alphacode-ai-coding-program-automatic-deepmind-codeforce)

  The company DeepMind created an AI system named AlphaCode that can autonomously solve coding problems at the same level as humans. It was tested on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com), a platform that provides coding problems and ranks its users, and was ranked top 28% of users in the past 6 months. However, these AI coding systems will not replace human programmers anytime soon due to their inherit bugs and security issues. For now, they'll simply be used a tool by human programmers.

* [Apple fined again over Dutch dating app payments order](https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/07/apple-third-dutch-antitrust-fine/)

  This TechCrunch article is about Apple's "antitrust standoff in the Netherlands". Apple has
  an outstanding 15M euros from this impasse over Apple's disallowing local dating apps to use
  third party payment providers, instead requiring such apps to use Apple's own payment
  infrastructure which Apple gets commissions from. Apple has been fighting the order, but just
  last month agreed to let apps use other payment providers. However, the Dutch government is
  still fined Apple over frustration with their general failure to comply.

* [Coinbase and Crypto Taxes](https://bgr.com/tech/coinbase-lets-you-receive-your-tax-refund-as-cryptocurrency/)

  Coinbase haș added onto their service so that users can have an easier time filing their
  taxes on their cryptocurrency. Taxpayers in the U.S. can see a personalized summary of
  their taxable activity: sales, conversions, payments, and income. They are even offering
  tax services for those who perform transactions without the service via CoinTracker. Furthermore,
  customers can now get their tax return deposited directly into their Coinbase account, as
  long as the customer has filed with TurboTax. This article makes readers think about how
  cryptocurrency continues to permeate society - normalizing the practice of owning and trading
  cryptocurrency and increasing the accessibility of each. It is also interesting to think
  about how a digital, decentralized medium of exchange exists in conjunction to something
  as essential to our centralized government as taxes.

* [New super-conductors could take data beyond zeroes and ones](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/02/220201161056.htm)

  There is potential for encoding data in new ways due to recent research in the field of spintronics. This research, conducted by a team at Duke University and Weizmann Institute resulted in the development of a conductor system that does not require cold temperatures in order to control the spinning of electrons and sending them over long distances. This development can potentially allow large magnitude spin currents to be created at room temperature, which may change how our current devices, such as smartphones, look.

* [Meta threatens to pull Facebook and Instagram from Europe if it can't target ads](https://itwire.com/listed-tech/meta-threatens-to-pull-facebook-and-instagram-from-europe-if-it-can-t-target-ads.html)

  In July 2020, the crucial decision from the European Union Court of Justice, Schrems II, ruled the Privacy Shield as null.
  The Privacy Sheild is a US law that allowed free transfer of personal data from EU to US companies.
  There are still other legal ways to send data EU-US, but the Schrems II ruling will have large ramifications on all American companies with users in the EU in the coming years.
  Meta is retaliating by threatening to pull its products from Europe if it is not allowed to share data with its US operations, saying stopping trans-atlantic data transfers will have devastating effects on its targeted ads.
  With Meta owning apps that have billions of users, this case will be an important precedent in the ongoing clash between big tech and governments.

* [Canada’s privacy watchdog probing health officials’ use of cellphone location data](https://globalnews.ca/news/8503895/watchdog-probing-officials-cell-location-data/)

  The Public Health Agency of Canada, or PHAC, has recently come under fire after it was revealed the government agency had been buying cellphone data from telecom companies in order to track its citizens. The *Global News* article elaborates that the Canadian cellphone provider, Telus, provided the PHAC location and movement data to give government officials in order to gain a greater understanding of the efficacy of their COVID-19 policy. The PHAC has also stated its planning on utilizing the information it purchased outside of solely COVID-19 research. While the data itself was scrubbed in order to prevent the identification of individuals, many are still asking the question as if current data and privacy laws are strong enough and if there needs to be a policy precedent set for government bodies buying or utilizing data from private entities.

* [The IRS Should Stop Using Facial Recognition](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/irs-should-stop-using-facial-recognition/621386/)

  ID.me's propietary facial recognition technology is not immune to bias despite their efforts to
  market it as such. The company specifically defines their services as outside the realm of "facial
  recognition" through a narrow definition in a 2022 white paper. They explicitly define two types of facial
  recognition: one-to-one, and one-to-many facial recognition and the company asserts that
  there are "significant benefits" to using 'one-to-one' facial recognition.  However, the company fails to
  mention the racial biases of one-to-one technology that cause both false positives and false
  negatives. Despite these overwhelming issues, "27 states, multiple federal agencies, and over 500
  name brand retailers" continue to use ID.me's techology further supporting the company's false claims.

* [What Is 5G? An Electrical Engineer Explains the Technology](https://scitechdaily.com/what-is-5g-an-electrical-engineer-explains-the-technology/)

  The 5th generation of cellular networks technology is 5G and offers 10 times more bandwidth than 4G.
  The speeds of 5G can deliver from 50 megabits up to 1 GB per
  second which can download large files and stream movies very fast and easily.
  There are different band frequencies 5G can use, being that lower-frequency waves
  can extend further out, but have slower speeds and higher-frequency waves
  have the fastest speeds, but do not travel as far and cost more money which is why it is used in high concentration areas
  like stadiums and airports. Even though 5G speeds can be extremely fast,
  the more people in the area that are using 5G can carry more traffic for the bandwidth
  and cause slower connection speeds. Even though there are minor problems with 5G,
  it is still improving and has to potential to be the best cellular network technology yet.

* [Blizzard is planning a new Warcraft mobile game](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/3/22916663/activision-blizzard-warcraft-mobile-game-2022-release-date)

  is the news Blizzard is working on a new Warcraft mobile title slated for a 2022 release. According to the press release, “Blizzard is planning substantial new content for the Warcraft franchise in 2022, including [...] getting all-new mobile Warcraft content into players’ hands for the first time". The news was delivered as a press release and not a traditional call ostensibly because of its pending acquisition by Microsoft. However, I do question if the warcraft mobile is going to be elease at 2022 due to the fact that other mobile games, such as Diablo immortal and Overwatch 2 was annoced to be developed much more earlier than Warcraft Mobile. Regardless, between this sudden news of a Warcraft mobile game and the announcement of a wholly new Blizzard-developed survival game, the company is putting its best foot forward to its (pending) Microsoft overlords.

* [Nvidia ready to abandon Arm acquisition, report says](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/01/nvidia-arm-deal-is-probably-dead-report-says/)

  Ars Technica's article discusses how Nvidia's planned acquisition of the CPU-design company Arm is likely to be abandoned, since Nvidia has had trouble convincing regulators the move would not pose a risk to competition and national security. The article also states that Arm's parent company seems to be moving towards taking Arm public, seemingly implying there is not much confidence in the approval of the acquisition. Since ARM chip designs have become increasingly popular due to their power efficiency, competitors to Nvidia are concerned that their access to these designs would be limited. In addition, nation-states such as China are concerned with a key technology falling under a US company.

* [A 1-mile stretch of road is being built in Detroit that can charge electric cars as they drive -- if owners install a special receiver](https://www.businessinsider.com/public-road-detroit-to-charge-electric-cars-as-they-drive-2022-2?utm_source=reddit.com)

  Tech startup Electreon Wireless is working with Ford and DTE to build an electrified road that charges cars through inductive charging.
  Through a special receiver that costs about $3,000 to $4,000 to install, cars can be charged while driving or stopped.
  The hope is that wireless charging will aid in mass EV adoption by easing concerns related to driving range.
  Similarly, researchers at Cornell have been working on wireless charging using electric fields instead of the magnetic ones that Electreon uses, a change that might make the process cheaper and more efficient.

* [Sony is buying Bungie, the developer of Destiny and original creator of Halo](https://www.theverge.com/22910846/sony-bungie-acquisition-playstation-destiny-halo)

  This article is about the recent aquisition of games developer Bungie by Sony Interactive Entertainment for 3.6 billon dollars. This seems problematic for the playerbase of Bungies current game "Destiny 2" because Sony owning Bungie may make Destiny 2 a PlayStation exclusive game. However, Bungie says that they have an agreement to remain independant and that the game will remain multi-platform and crossplay and will not feature PlayStation exlusive content, something that has existed in Destiny 2 before. This is similar to Microsoft's aqusition of Activision Blizzard, a sign of console companies buying developers around them to support their respective platforms.

* [Sunroom is an alternative creator platform empowering women to cash in](https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/02/sunroom-creator-platform-app-women/)

  This TechCrunch article is about Sunroom, a new social media app aiming to address the
  heavy content moderation many women and non-binary content creators face on popular social
  media apps, such as Instagram by building a more open-minded platform where creators,
  only women and non-binary creators as of now, can profit off their work. As the article
  notes, Sunroom “isn’t trying to make another OnlyFans”. Instead, they hope to make a social
  media platform with limited censorship, where women and non-binary people can break down
  stigmas to profit off their creative work. The app has only 100 content creators as of its
  launch, and hopes to scale slowly to keep hands-on moderation and censorship low.

* [6 Reasons Meta Is in Trouble](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/03/technology/facebook-meta-challenges.html)

  *NY Times*'s article discusses possibilities to explain and foreshadow Meta's current and future troubles regarding the Metaverse, Facebook, and Instagram after their stock "plunged by more than 230 billion dollars". The current issues Meta faces includes hitting their user growth ceiling, changes in the data privacy from companies like Apple, and how new apps such as TikTok and Reels have affected their ways of making money off of their users. To begin with, Apple introduced an __App Tracking Transparency__ update to its operating system, "giving users the choice to ... let apps like Facebook monitor their online activities", disallowing them useful marketing data to make money off of ads, their most successful platform. Furthermore, apps such as Tiktok "present [Facebook with] a conundrum" due to the fact that to compete with Tiktok they have to focus on Reels, however while they have been very successful for bringing viewership to Instagram, they make the least amount of money per ad as users "tend to skip right past them". These newfound opponents of ad-space, users, and data privacy, along with Facebook's questionable funding of the Metaverse, have placed a dark cloud over Meta, scaring potential investors away leading to their stock plummet.

  This article talks about the effect that Apple's new privacy policies have had on
  the profits of various social media companies. The new policies regard user's
  abilities to choose the extent to which advertisers can track them, and services
  such as Meta, Snap, Twitter, and others have expressed displeasure with these
  policies and have since experienced lower stock prices as a result. This is an
  interesting article because it emphasizes the conflict between ethics and profits
  in the technology industry. It also shows that Apple has an incredible amount of
  power over many other big technological services.

* [Sony Buys Bungie for $3.6 Billion](https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-sony-buys-bungie)

  Sony recently announced that it would be acquiring Bungie, the original developers of Halo and
  current developers of Destiny 2, for 3.6 billion dollars, with 1.2 billion being paid to the studio's
  employees. It is theorized that this 1.2 billion is intended to keep developers from leaving at this
  time. Some also have speculated that this is in response to Microsoft's recent announcement
  that they intend to acquire Activision Blizzard. However, that would not necessarily make sense,
  as the purchase of such a large game studio as Bungie would take more than a couple of weeks,
  and there is certainly more incentive for Sony to purchase a multi-platform game studio.
  Nevertheless, it could also be in response to other huge acquisitions by Microsoft, including that
  of Zenimax Media Inc., the parent company of Bethesda.

  According to U.S. News, the state of Texas plans to sue Meta over the use of Texans' biometric data
  without their consent. The lawsuit claims that Meta has allegedly used biometric data of the 20.5 million
  Texans who use Meta "billions of times." A Meta spokesperson has since denied these allegations saying that
  these claims are "without merit" and that they will fight to defend themselves. In November 2021, Meta said
  that they were stopping their facial recognition system, and that the data collected was being deleted;
  however, this data is supposedly being distributed to others without their consent, and was failed in being deleted.
  
* [What is Edge AI and How Does It Work?](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2022/02/17/what-is-edge-ai/)

  This NVIDIA article explains new developments made in the area of Edge AI. It goes on to say that Edge AI is where 
  AI applications in devices are sent out into the physical world. The word “edge" is used because the AI computations
  are done at the edge of the network, rather than centrally in something like a cloud computing facility.
  These AI applications are learning to perform tasks in the midst of the "infinite circumstances" that humans are faced
  with in everyday life. These AI have many uses, and it is claimed that they provide a "robust infrastructure" for general AI.

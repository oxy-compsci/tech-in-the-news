* [Sunroom is an alternative creator platform empowering women to cash in](https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/02/sunroom-creator-platform-app-women/)

  This TechCrunch article is about Sunroom, a new social media app aiming to address the
  heavy content moderation many women and non-binary content creators face on popular social
  media apps, such as Instagram by building a more open-minded platform where creators,
  only women and non-binary creators as of now, can profit off their work. As the article
  notes, Sunroom “isn’t trying to make another OnlyFans”. Instead, they hope to make a social
  media platform with limited censorship, where women and non-binary people can break down
  stigmas to profit off their creative work. The app has only 100 content creators as of its
  launch, and hopes to scale slowly to keep hands-on moderation and censorship low.

* [6 Reasons Meta Is In Trouble](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/03/technology/facebook-meta-challenges.html)

  *NY Times*'s article dicusses possibilities to explain and foreshadow Meta's current and future troubles regarding the Metaverse, Facebook, and Instagram after their stock "plunged by more than 230 billion dollars". The current issues Meta faces includes hitting their user growth ceiling, changes in the data privacy from companies like Apple, and how new apps such as TikTok and Reels have affected their ways of making money off of their users. To begin with, Apple introduced an __App Tracking Transparency__ update to its operating system, "giving users the choice to ... let apps like Facebook monitor their online activities", disallowing them useful marketing data to make money off of ads, their most successful platform. Furthermore, apps such as Tiktok "present [Facebook with] a conundrum" due to the fact that to compete with Tiktok they have to focus on Reels, however while they have been very successful for bringing viewership to Instagram, they make the least amount of money per ad as users "tend to skip right past them". These newfond opponents of ad-space, users, and data privacy, along with Facebook's questionable funding of the Metaverse, have placed a dark cloud over Meta, scaring potential investors away leading to their stock plummet. 


* [SingularityDAO’s AI-powered ‘DynaSets’ outperform the crypto market](https://artificialintelligence-news.com/2022/02/11/singularitydaos-ai-powered-dynasets-outperform-the-crypto-market/)

  SingularityDAO recently created an AI that determined Dynasets, or selections of specific amounts of cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin or Ethereum), which performed well regardless of the instability of the crypto market. Creating this AI involved combining AI algorithms with professional hedge fund traders to maximize profits and minimize losses. Despite the market being incredibly volatile with "Bitcoin crashing around 50 percent between November 2021 and the end of January 2022", the BitCoin DynaSet (or DynaSet with BitCoin as one of the cryptocurrencies) had "10.3% better performance over just 'hodling" (holding and buying) Bitcoin". As well as, after their collaboration with Cardano to fix issues with Ethereum trading, the Ethereum DynaSet had a "12.59% better performance over just hodling Ethereum". While the project is still in beta, it's clear that with more tweaks, that the AI may be utilized for crypto asset protection in the future.

* [Toward a stronger defense of personal data](https://news.mit.edu/2022/application-specific-integrated-circuit-iot-chip-0218)

  Researchers at MIT have developed an "application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip", with the power to defend against "side-channel" attacks, or attacks that seek to gather secret information via an exploitation of a system and/or its hardware. An example of a side attack is the exploitation of the hardware on a smartwatch by inspecting the device's power consumption to get private health data about the individual. The ASIC chip answers this issue by using "threshold computing", which splits the data into "unique, random components" which are then operated on in a random order as well before getting the final result. Their chip was a success as with the default implementation "they were able to recover hidden information... in about 1000 power waveforms (representations of power usage over time)". Whereas, with the new hardware, "even after collecting 2 million waveforms, they still could not recover the data". However, now the main issue that has come up is the design: while it provides significant security against these attacks, "the chip requires 5.5 times more power and 1.6 times more silicon area than a baseline insecure implementation." The researchers, however, argue that "[We're willing to trading] off some amount of energy consumption to make a more secure computation", arguing that it can be utilized while more energy-sustainable models are created in the future.

* [Using artificial intelligence to find anomalies hiding in massive datasets](https://news.mit.edu/2022/artificial-intelligence-anomalies-data-0225)

  In complex grid data such as power grid or water grid data, determining the probabilities of anomalies (such as a spike in voltage) is very difficult, as power grid data consists of many incoming data points very second from different sensors across the grid. At IBM-Watson's MIT AI Lab, researchers have devised an efficient method for determining these malfunctions in data streams in real time, and turning these complex probabilities into more managable ones. They argue that their artifical intelligence method is much better at detecting them than other popular techniques. Deriving this method involved using concepts in Baynesian networks, individual probabilities, probability density, and even techniques in deep learning like "normalizing form" which allow an artifical intelligence to see a complicated network of multidimensional data points as an interconnected Baynesian network or interconnected grid. As the AI learns the causal structure of the data it receives, it can begin to construct causal structures between sensors and convert otherwise complex probabilities into more managable ones for researchers to investigate.
  In preparing and testing this method, they used previous data of grid networks such as power grid data, water grid data, and traffic data which contains anomalies that'd been previously identified and solved by humans. What they found was that their model "outperformed all the baselines by detecting a higher percentage of true anomalies in each dataset". To go further, their model involved no supervision, as the AI learns on its own this causal grid structure; the researchers hope that this solution can be mapped to other datasets and complex forms of data.

* [3 Questions: Fotini Christia on racial equity and data science](https://news.mit.edu/2022/3-questions-fotini-christia-racial-equity-and-data-science-0303)

  Recently, a MIT-wide effort was launched to address systemic racism with the help of social science and computation. By using lots of data, they hope to develop tools that can create "structural and normative change toward equity". As of recently, existing data has shown racial discrimination in many avenues of the job market, including education and healthcare. Data science tools "can not only identify, but also contribute to, proposing fixes on racially inequitable outcomes that result from implicit or explicit biases [from]... the use of AI and algorithmic methods in decision-making". After creating these tools, they will place them in neighborhoods where indirect systemic racism exists (e.g. neighborhoods with minorities) and test these tools for their racial equity. Computation comes into play with "causal analysis" of these racial disparities and how the several structures and institutions within society have all played a role in systemic racism (both now and overtime). As a whole, this movement (ICSR) is a part of the IDSS and Fotini Christia, who looks to research issues of conflict and cooperation in the Muslim world, but has since extended to investigating systemic racism with the help of social sciences, data science, and computation.

* [TikTok limits services as Netflix pulls out of Russia](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60641988)

  The article focuses on how certain platforms, specifically Netflix and Tik Tok, have cut off their services in Russia amidst the invasion of Ukraine. Tik Tok has suspended live streaming and new content as the company tries to slow the spread of “fake news” regarding Russian armed forces. Tik tok explains this as a safety measure to ensure the protection of its staff and its users. According to the article, anyone reported writing “fake news” about the military can have upto 15 years in prison. There are approximately 36 million Russian Tik Tok-users, making it one of the company’s largest territories. Russian users can currently only view content; the restrictions on producing content is to protect people from being charged with “fake news”. Tik Tok has only recently released a statement regarding the invasion of Ukraine saying it was “devastating” and that it brought “pain to our community and our people”. Netflix has, since last week, halted all projects in Russia and stopped streaming services. Other companies have suspended operations: Burberry, H&M, Jaguar Land Rover, Apple. Visa, Mastercard and American Express have also suspended operations.


* [Using artificial intelligence to find anomalies hiding in massive datasets](https://techxplore.com/news/2022-02-artificial-intelligence-anomalies-massive-datasets.html)

  Some MIT researchers have created a method that is able to point out anomalies in real time from data streams in an efficient way. This model does not need to be trained on annotated data on power grid anomalies, which makes it suitable for real life situations that don’t have cleaned up data of good quality. One possible use of the model includes monitoring traffic and water systems. Although other models do exist, the researchers conclude that their model performs better when it comes to pointing out anomalies. This is because their model was able to detect a higher percent of the true anomalies that existed in the datasets that were tested.

* [Valve has no plans for a 'Steam Pass,' but would help Microsoft put Game Pass on Steam](https://www.pcgamer.com/valve-has-no-plans-for-a-steam-pass-but-would-help-microsoft-put-game-pass-on-steam/)

  With the highly anticipated launch of the Steam Deck this taking place this week,
  Valve has responded to speculations that they might release a competitor to Xbox
  Game Pass. Although they shut down the rumors, they opened the door for Microsoft
  to put their subscription service on the Steam platform, an anomaly in the console
  space. Although Game Pass games are theoretically playable already by installing Windows,
  putting Game Pass on Steam would open up a large library to casual gamers. Despite claims
  that this would not make sense from Microsoft's viewpoint, the same was said about Xbox
  games coming to Steam, which recently took place.

* [Toward a stronger defense of personal data](https://news.mit.edu/2022/application-specific-integrated-circuit-iot-chip-0218)

  Researchers at MIT have developed an "application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip", with the power to defend against "side-channel" attacks, or attacks that seek to gather secret information via an exploitation of a system and/or its hardware. An example of a side attack is the exploitation of the hardware on a smartwatch by inspecting the device's power consumption to get private health data about the individual. The ASIC chip answers this issue by using "threshold computing", which splits the data into "unique, random components" which are then operated on in a random order as well before getting the final result. Their chip was a success as with the default implementation "they were able to recover hidden information... in about 1000 power waveforms (representations of power usage over time)". Whereas, with the new hardware, "even after collecting 2 million waveforms, they still could not recover the data". However, now the main issue that has come up is the design: while it provides significant security against these attacks, "the chip requires 5.5 times more power and 1.6 times more silicon area than a baseline insecure implementation." The researchers, however, argue that "[We're willing to trading] off some amount of energy consumption to make a more secure computation", arguing that it can be utilized while more energy-sustainable models are created in the future.

* [Using artificial intelligence to find anomalies hiding in massive datasets](https://news.mit.edu/2022/artificial-intelligence-anomalies-data-0225)

  In complex grid data such as power grid or water grid data, determining the probabilities of anomalies (such as a spike in voltage) is very difficult, as power grid data consists of many incoming data points very second from different sensors across the grid. At IBM-Watson's MIT AI Lab, researchers have devised an efficient method for determining these malfunctions in data streams in real time, and turning these complex probabilities into more managable ones. They argue that their artifical intelligence method is much better at detecting them than other popular techniques. Deriving this method involved using concepts in Baynesian networks, individual probabilities, probability density, and even techniques in deep learning like "normalizing form" which allow an artifical intelligence to see a complicated network of multidimensional data points as an interconnected Baynesian network or interconnected grid. As the AI learns the causal structure of the data it receives, it can begin to construct causal structures between sensors and convert otherwise complex probabilities into more managable ones for researchers to investigate.
  In preparing and testing this method, they used previous data of grid networks such as power grid data, water grid data, and traffic data which contains anomalies that'd been previously identified and solved by humans. What they found was that their model "outperformed all the baselines by detecting a higher percentage of true anomalies in each dataset". To go further, their model involved no supervision, as the AI learns on its own this causal grid structure; the researchers hope that this solution can be mapped to other datasets and complex forms of data.

* [Tesla’s reverse on battery cells signals shift for electric vehicles](https://www.ft.com/content/accde2e1-08a2-4bc3-bbb1-1a1e72eb4508)

  This article by June Yoon delves into Tesla’s recent decision for
  its cars to start using lithium iron phosphate batteries. This is
  caused by the recent surge in prices for raw materials in the world
  of batteries for electric cars. The article points out how this type
  of battery is widely used for less sophisticated devices such as
  golf carts and residential back-up power systems. But iron-based
  batteries are a much less efficient option for electric cars as they
  have a lower energy density than the nickel, cobalt, and manganese
  batteries, which are currently used in most electric cars. Being
  iron-based, these batteries will in turn offers less driving
  distance on a single charge. The main advantage in switching towards
  iron-based batteries is the price: they cost about 30 per cent per
  battery cell than their nickel-rich counterparts. Another advantage
  is that they are thermally more stable, meaning a lower risk of
  fires. Battery-caused car fires have costed companies such as
  General Motors upwards of $2 billion and Supplier LG Energy solution
  an estimated $1.2 billion. Tesla’s decision to switch to iron-based
  batteries has inspired other carmakers such as Volkswagen to plan to
  use them as well. However, a switch to iron-based batteries would
  mean a powershift for China, as the country produces more than 95%
  of iron-based battery cells and controls more than 80% of the
  world’s refining and mining aof electric car battery raw materials.

* [NASA Offers Up to $200 Million to Help Push New Technologies to Market](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-offers-up-to-200-million-to-help-push-new-technologies-to-market)

  Through Tipping Point, NASA seeks to support space technologies that can foster
  the growth of commercial space capabilities and benefit future agency missions.
  “Public-private partnerships established through these opportunities will combine
  agency resources with industry contributions, a benefit that will unlock new ideas to
  advance how we live and work in space while providing greater value to the American
  people.” These opportunities focus on technology development for space
  infrastructure and capabilities for the Moon and near-Earth space. "Forging strong
  partnerships with the commercial space economy is critical for driving our nation’s
  space exploration further and faster," said Jim Reuter, associate administrator for the
  Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) at NASA’s Headquarters in Washington,
  which manages the new opportunities. More than half a billion dollars have been awarded to 50
  projects since NASA announced the first Tipping Point opportunity in 2015. Space
  x  technologies advanced through this funding are now part of current and future mission plans.

* [China Is About to Regulate AI—and the World Is Watching](https://www.wired.com/story/china-regulate-ai-world-watching/)

  Chinese government is on the move to regulate corperates' AI algorithm uses that set prices, control search results, recommend videos, and filter content. Some car hailing apps in china uses AI algorithm to provide different prices for different users. For instence, the platform may offer a lower price for the same ride based on users usage and price of the phone they use. In one of Prsident Xi jinping's speech in Octorber, he said there are "unhealthy and disorderly signals and trendds" regarding china's digital economy development. Based on the new 'INternet information Service Algorithmic Recommendatio Management Provisions' will enforce corperates and individual use Ai in unlawful and unhealfy ways online. Certain provisions of the new regulations may prove challenging or impossible to enforce. Controlling the behavior of an algorithm that is constantly changing due to new input, for example, might be technically tough.

* [Why SNK shifted to Unreal Engine for its latest fighting games](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/developer-interviews/why-snk-shifted-to-unreal-engine-for-its-latest-fighting-games)

  SNK decided to use the unreal engine for their latest game, The King of Fighters XV, which helped the development and quality of the final product. The unreal engine provided benefits to development such as easier time porting and enhanced shader capabilities. SNK used unreal engine for their previous title Samurai Shodown, which was a success and they are developing a future game with unreal engine. The King of Fighters XIV did not use unreal engine, but SNK was experimenting with unreal engine during that game's development, so the transition was easy.

* [Tesla wants its cars to be Steam compatible](https://www.pcgamer.com/tesla-wants-its-cars-to-be-steam-compatible/)

  In a tweet, Elon Musk reveals that Tesla is working towards making their cars Steam compatible. New Tesla models currently have an AMD GPU that is able to run demanding games on the dashboard. The dashboard makes use of a Linux operating system, which Steam currently is optimizing for things like the Steam Deck. The only confirmation of this happening is Elon Musk’s tweet. Also Tesla is currently being investigated by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for some games being playable while driving, which has been disabled since last December.

* [Google lowered its salaries in North Carolina. Now workers are protesting.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/02/18/google-raleigh-hbcu-salary/)

  Google has lowered its employees salaries and stock benefits below national level for some of its North Carolina offices.
  Representatives from Google claim this change was to readjust to offer competitive pay relative to the local market.
  However, affected workers view the adjustment as problematic.
  This is partly because many employees moved to the area before the salary cut for the lower cost of living, and Google had "record-breaking performance in the stock market, in spite of Covid-19," and so should be rewarding its workers rather than cutting salaries.
  A larger reason for upset is also the cut happening simultaneously with Google's plans to make the company more diverse by hiring black engineers in areas like Durnham, North Carolina.
  Thus, critics raise the question of if Google is exploiting the very hires that will make their company more diverse.

* [Ransomware-Related Data Leaks Jump 82% in 2021](https://www.technewsworld.com/story/ransomware-related-data-leaks-jump-82-in-2021-87419.html)

  This article goes over the alarming 2021 cyber security report about the prevalence and danger of ransomware attacks.
  The report states that there were 2,686 attacks in 2021 compared to 1,474 attacks in 2020, which is an 82% increase.
  Perpetrators are evolving their approaches with ransomware, such as accessing legitamite login credentials to takeover system functions,
  as a way to bypass antivirus products. The report also notes that almost 49% of the attacks are financially motivated, and a prime example
  was the "lock and leak" attacks observed where the data is not only encrypted for ransom but also stolen to sell online. Such attacks are growing
  in popularity because of the many vulnerabilites in a company's cloud and server infrastructure that can be exploited by these attackers. It's
  with a warning that "adversaries continue to adapt to security environments" and this will only continue in 2022.

* [Losing Tech War To China? After Hypersonic Missiles, Ex-Google CEO Says US Far Behind In Another Critical Technology](https://eurasiantimes.com/google-ceo-says-us-far-behind-in-another-critical-technology/)

  The article argues that China is rapidly overtaking the United States in the competition to develop and produce what the former Google CEO, Eric Schmidt, refers to as “strategically important technology”. One of these crucial advancements is in hypersonic technology. In July of last year China conducted a hypersonic weapon test that launched a missile around the world at a speed 5x faster than the speed of sound. China has also recently expanded greatly in its investment of 5G services. China has invested approximately 50x as much in 5G technology as the United States, with a total of $50 billion investment in the country. Schmidt goes on to criticize the United State’s failure to not only effectively allocate resources to hypersonic and 5G technology, but also to high tech manufacturing, green energy and AI. The primary concern is the security threat that technological stagnation poses to the United States. In recent news, Chinese researchers claim to have successfully reached a wireless transmission speed of 206.25 gigabits per second, suggesting 6G technology may be 100x faster than 5G. This combined with hypersonic missiles highlights the growing disparity in tech design as the United States struggles to rollout 5G across the country. The only solution provided is an increased  amount of funding into research to continue securing the United States position as a global leader in technological advancement.

* [Google moves to make Android apps more private](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60403963)

  Google plans to increase privacy on android apps alongside the Chrome browser. By 2023 the use of third party cookies is supposedly planned to be removed from Chrome. Overall, the sharing of user data will be more limited so that advertisers will not be able to gain much access to it. However, in the past, the article highlights that Google’s attempts to make up for third party cookies have been unsuccessful, such as in the case of Floc (Federated Learning of Cohorts). Additionally, details on specific implementation methods have not yet been provided.

* [Texas Sues Meta's Facebook Over Facial-Recognition Practices](https://www.usnews.com/news/technology/articles/2022-02-14/texas-sues-meta-over-facebooks-facial-recognition-practices-report)

  According to U.S. News, the state of Texas plans to sue Meta over the use of Texans' biometric data
  without their consent. The lawsuit claims that Meta has allegedly used biometric data of the 20.5 million
  Texans who use Meta "billions of times." A Meta spokesperson has since denied these allegations saying that
  these claims are "without merit" and that they will fight to defend themselves. In November 2021, Meta said
  that they were stopping their facial recognition system, and that the data collected was being deleted;
  however, this data is supposedly being distributed to others without their consent, and was failed in being deleted.

* [What is Edge AI and How Does It Work?](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2022/02/17/what-is-edge-ai/)

  This NVIDIA article explains new developments made in the area of Edge AI. It goes on to say that Edge AI is where
  AI applications in devices are sent out into the physical world. The word “edge" is used because the AI computations
  are done at the edge of the network, rather than centrally in something like a cloud computing facility.
  These AI applications are learning to perform tasks in the midst of the "infinite circumstances" that humans are faced
  with in everyday life. These AI have many uses, and it is claimed that they provide a "robust infrastructure" for general AI.

* [Kanye West’s $200 Stem Player will be the only way to get his next album, Donda 2](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/18/22940748/donda-2-stem-player-kanye-west-exclusive-music)

  Kanye West announced this week that his upcoming album, Donda 2, would only be available on
  his "stem Player" platform, and would not be coming to normal streaming platforms. He claims
  that this is in response to the fact that artists only get 12% of the money that the industry
  makes, with streaming platforms taking large percentages. Launched with his previous album, the
  Stem Player is an interesting device that allows for the onboard music to be manipulated, although
  it was nowhere near as functional as a proper mixing device, nor is it as convenient to use as
  streaming platforms. Notably, this is not the first time Kanye has attempted to avoid mainstream
  streaming platforms, since he tried something similar several years ago. However, it seems
  less likely he will backtrack this time, unlike the last, given the current state of the music
  industry and criticism of platforms such as Spotify.

* [GitHub launches code scanning scheme to hunt down vulnerabilities](https://www.techradar.com/news/github-launches-code-scanning-scheme-to-hunt-down-vulnerabilities)

  This TechRadar article discusses a new experimental feature that GitHub has released, which will automatically scan code to see if it has vulnerabilities that could enable SQL injection, cross-site scripting, or other exploits. The scanner is powered by machine learning and currently only processes JavaScript and TypeScript code. If a vulnerability is found, the user will be notified in the security tab of their repository. The article then goes on to contextualize how this feature is another way in which GitHub seeks to implement automation in its service, following the development of GitHub Copilot.

* [We tested Apple's new option to unlock an iPhone while wearing a mask](https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/tech/apple-face-id-mask/index.html)

  This article discusses Apple's new software update, which includes a new feature that enables users to unlock their phone with face id even while wearing a mask. There has been a loss of one Apple's most convenient features over the last couple years as face id does not work when people wear a mask. Apple also has stated that this update should allow for better results when wearing sunglasses and/or a hat and trying to unlock your phone. This upcoming update is big news, as it means we won't have the annoying issue of typing in our passcode or pulling off our mask in public to unlock our phones. The convenience of face id is a big feature that was revolutionary when it was first released, and these new updates should improve it more. It will be interesting to see how effective the new changes are. An initial test with the beta revealed that while it was able to unlock the device with a mask on, there were still some inconsistencies. There were times that they were prompted to input their passcode to unlock the phone, but Apple will likely address this issue before releasing fully in the next update.

* [Google also enforcing rules to honor user privacy to detriment of advertisers](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/16/google-plans-android-privacy-change-similar-to-apples.html)

  Google has also announced that they will enforce policies that limit advertisers' ability to track users' activity.
  Currently, Google/Android users each have a unique ID that advertisers can use to track their activity. However,
  Google plans to revise this in the future. However, there is an important difference between Google's approach and
  that of Apple (who also recently announced changing to protect users' privacy from advertisers); Apple released their
  changes immediately, allowing users to block advertisers from tracking their activity, while Google has announced
  that their changes will not fully take effect for about two more years (they will continue supporting the user ID's
  for at least two years). This gives advertisers/social media companies who rely on them time to adjust and come up
  with new approaches. I think it is interesting that Apple and Google approached this differently, and I wonder
  whether Google's softer approach was influenced by the fact that Apple's privacy changes were met with strong
  backlash/criticism because of how abrupt their changes were.

* [Maybe Green Energy Needs 'Information Batteries' Too](https://www.wired.com/story/maybe-green-energy-needs-information-batteries-too/)

  To save on the large amount of energy used for computing, researchers suggest pre commuting information necessary and storing it away in "information batteries", during times when clean power is available and saving it for when it is not. Companies like Google and Facebook that use up alot of energy for pre computable things like search results or friend suggestions and by doing that work asynchronously and storing it, they reduce their consumption. Similar strategies are used by others who do their heavy processing at night when there is less usage by others. However, pre computing for information batteries would not be able to predict the future of what will be needed but only parts of it.

* [Bionic eyes: Obsolete tech leaves patients in the dark](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60416058)

  People who used retinal implants (Argus II) from Second Sight are being left figuratively and literally in the dark. Second sight almost went out of business and so they discontinued Argus II. This meant that people who currently have it have no one to go to for support or repairs of the retinal implant. The Argus is an implanted electrode array that stimulates the eye according to the video being recorded by the glasses of users. This showcases our vulnerability to tech and the continuance of it.

* [Crypto money laundering rises 30%, report finds](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60072195)

  In thie article, the author claims that more criminals chooses to use crypto currency to laundering money due to low transaction fees with while decentralisation offers criminals greater anonymity and security protection from the authorities. Chainalysis says that after tracking cryto currency wallets controleed by criminals they found that they have laundered over $8.6 billions of cryptocurrency in 2021, "up by 30%" since 2020.  According to the research, cryptocurrency laundering accounts for 17% of all monies sent from unlawful wallets, up from 2% in 2016. Money from offline crime, such as drug trafficking funds converted to cryptocurrencies to be laundered, is not covered, and the report warns that this could be a growing area. The paper claims that this is low in comparison to more traditional ways of money laundering, "suggesting that Bitcoin-based laundering could become increasingly attractive to traditional criminals."

* [Silicon Valley is no longer the edgy tech frontier as workers flee Google and Amazon for crypto and Web3 startups, recruiters say]( https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-workers-leaving-for-crypto-web3-startups-silicon-valley-recruiters-2022-2)

  Katie Canales’ Business Insider article details how recently there
  has been a trend of high-profile executives and developers leaving
  established firms to find jobs in crypto and other decentralized
  tech ventures. A leading example of this is how the former CMO of
  Meta’s digital wallet project, Novi, has left the company to pursue
  a position at the blockchain-focused payments company Circle. This
  effect is similar to that of the wave of job switching in the early
  2010s that saw the arrival of companies such as Uber and Lyft.
  Whether or not this is just a trend in Silicon Valley or a lasting
  impact, only the future will know what is in store for the workers
  who leave for crypto and Web3 startups.

* [Watching Me, Watching You: How Eye Tracking Is Coming to VR and Beyond](https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/watching-me-watching-you-how-eye-tracking-is-coming-to-vr-and-beyond/)

  Experts at Tobii, an eye tracking tech company, believe that eye tracking is the next big leap
  in VR and AR technology. By integrating eye tracking into AR and VR, software engineers can redistribute
  graphics processing power, allow avatars to make eye contact, and integrate new eye controls.  However,
  there is a big security concern regarding the data that will be collected from users' eye movements.
  Fortunately, software companies like Tobii, are brainstorming user agreements that will explain
  what data is being collected to better inform users before they allow thier data to be tracked.

* [Cryptocurrency is akin to 'Ponzi scheme' and banning it is 'perhaps the most advisable choice', says India's Central Bank](https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/15/india-central-bank-cryptocurrency-ponzi-banning/)

  This TechCrunch article is about a high up official of India's central bank calling cryptocurrencies
  akin to ponzi schemes just after the Indian government began legalizing cryptocurrencies through its
  aim to tax them. He advocates for banning cryptocurrencies, saying, "They threaten the financial
  sovereignty of a country and make it susceptible to strategic manipulation by private corporates creating
  these currencies or governments that control them". This article highlights the acceptance and rejection
  of cryptocurrencies worldwide, specifically in India.

* [Reface, a viral face-swap app from Ukraine, adds anti-war push notifications](https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/27/reface-a-viral-face-swap-app-from-ukraine-adds-anti-war-push-notifications/)

  Reface, a Ukrainian face-swap app, is sending push notifications to its user base of approximately 200 million
  asking them to stand with the Ukraine against Russian invasion with the hashtag #StandWithUkraine and by
  watermarking videos made on their app with a Ukrainian flag. Moreover, an image of sheltering civilians in Kyiv
  has replaced the home page and displays messages for Russia to be excluded from a banking system in addition to
  info on how to help Ukrainians during this time. In light of Russia's invasion, this app is trying to highlight
  these wrongdoings and bring attention and help to the situation in Ukraine.

* [Alex Frangi created an AI to predict heart attack risk fromo a retina scan](https://spectrum.ieee.org/retina-scan)

  A professor at the University of Leeds in England and his research assistants have been conducting research on pre-heart-attack symptoms, and how to notify the patient that they are at risk.  Data was collected from tens of thousands of individuals who had gotten recent retina scans, as well as over 5,000 cases of people who had both a retina and cardiac magnetic resnoance scan.  The data was split into 10 parts for training, and by the end the AI was able to correctly predict a heart attack 70-80% of the time.  This is a major upgrade from a doctors diagnosis for a few reasons.  First, it is much quicker.  Current methods for determining heart attack risk required blood samples as well as use of an electrocardiogram, while yhe AI only needs a retina scan, which is much faster and more patient friendly.  This is also a much cheaper option since the technology required for a retina scan is much simpler than that of CMR scans.  Retina scans will also be much more available to the general public through the use of phones.  Eventually each phone will be capable of performing a retina scan, which when mixed with this AI will give everyone the ability to test their own risk of a heart attack without requiring a doctors involvement. Finally in testing, the AI performed 10% better than any previous methods did, suggesting that this AI is capable of determining risk of a heart attack quicker, cheaper, more conveniently, and more accurately than current methods.

* [Microsoft purchasing Activision](https://news.microsoft.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-to-acquire-activision-blizzard-to-bring-the-joy-and-community-of-gaming-to-everyone-across-every-device/)

  This is an article about Microsoft recently purchasing the game developing company Activision Blizzard. They are responsible for many popular games such as Overwatch, Call of Duty World of Warcraft, the Diablo franchise, and many others.  In recent years the company has seen its profits dropping as their games fall out of relevancy, with no new releases gaining widespread popularity.  On January 18th, Microsoft that they would purchase Blizzard for an estimated $70 billion which is now the largest video game purchase of all time. After this sale, Microsoft will become the third biggest game developing company in the world, behind Tencent and Sony.  Currently the videogame market is extremely profitable, with an estimated 3 billion people actively engaged in at least one game.  While this new ownership would likely reignight Blizzards popularity, it is concerning how Microsoft is slowly purchasing all smaller game dev comapines. Continuing this could make it much more difficult for future game dev companies to enter the market, and further strengthen the oligopoly that top companies share today.

* [Synthetic Data Usage in AI](https://spectrum.ieee.org/synthetic-data-ai)

  This segment from IEEE talks about a company called Omniverse which is pushing for the usage of synthetic data in training AI.  Omniverse is meant to be a simulated version of reality with the minimum amount of important physics aspects implemented in order to simulate a real world setting in VR. This would allow the user to create environments to perform tests, such as on the top of a frozen mountain or middle of a desert without actually having to go to that location to gather data.  While creating "fake data" may seem like it would not be as impactful as data recorded in the real world, it would allow AI training in areas where data cannot be gathered morally or easily.  For example, Omniverse simulated a series of dangerous environments to gather data for self-driving cars.  Data was gathered on icy roads, sudden sharp turns, when animals/people run into the road, broken brakes, etc.  Most of this data would be very dangerous and immoral to gather legitimately, but training for these situations allows the self-driving cars to react approopriately to emergencies.  As the VR simulation of reality becomes more accurate data can be gathered easier and more efficiently, which could pave the way for widespread synthetic data usage in future AI.

* [To protect consumers, Congress should secure the app store supply chain](https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/15/to-protect-consumers-congress-should-secure-the-app-store-supply-chain/)

  Earlier this month, the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved the Open App Market Act, a bill mandating that smartphone makers allow users to install unvetted applications on their devices.
  This bill is a big change from the "walled garden" distribution model of today that only allows app installation from official app stores.
  The "walled garden" model ensures higher levels of safety through basic safety screening, but cuts down on the amount of available free apps for users.
  Allowing users to install unvetted apps poses bigger security risks especially for individuals and smaller businesses that do not have the necessary security features to monitor software.
  With that said, Congress has the ability to enforce regulations that mitigate those risks, including requiring all app stores to have base levels of security, moving away from unrestricted "side-loading", and educating users on good device hygiene.

* [White Castle to hire 100 robots to flip burgers](https://www.today.com/food/restaurants/white-castle-hire-100-robots-flip-burgers-rcna16770)

  Having first experimented with 'Flippy 1' robotic cooks back in September 2020, White Castle has plans to roll out the upgraded 'Flippy 2' at over 100 locations.
  The robots, made and manufactured by Miso Robotics, have the capability to take over the entire fry station, allowing employees to focus on customer-facing duties.
  The combination of fast food and AI is not novel to White Castle, as other popular chains like McDonald's, Sonic, and Checkers have been working to streamline their drive-thru operations with AI tools.
  Nonetheless, White Castle's program is being phased in by region, with hopes to be in over a third of the 350 locations they have across the Midwest, Southwest, and New York area.

* [AI could be the perfect tool for exploring the universe](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/15/16654352/ai-astronomy-space-exploration-data)

  Astronomers have begun using AI to detect gravitational lenses in images. Gravitational lenses occur when a massive object like a galaxy or a black hole comes between an observer on Earth and a
  light source, which bends space and light allowing astronomers to see parts of the universe they normally would be unable to see. Finding these lenses among massive amounts of data is very time
  consuming to do by hand, but by using machine learning, they’ve gotten a detection rate of roughly one per minute as opposed to five or six lenses found for a week of work by hand. This data
  sorting has the potential to extract more information from data we already have, and collect significantly more information quicker, and more accurately.

  The US Department of Justice confiscated a record high amount of Bitcoin last week. Two people were caught attempting to launder the stolen money from a hack in 2016 that resulted in around
  120,000 Bitcoin being stolen from the crypto exchange Bitfinex. Around 94,000 Bitcoin have been recovered and the pair could serve up to 25 years in prison if found guilty.

* [How Misleading Videos About Russia's Invasion of Ukraine Spread on Twitter](https://www.cnet.com/news/how-misleading-videos-about-russias-invasion-of-ukraine-spread-on-twitter/)

  A video posted on Twitter as news of Russia's invasion of Ukraine circulated the internet shows buildings being lit up by a bright flash followed by a loud boom. “Mariupol”, a city in south
  eastern Ukraine and the misleading caption of the video, implies a relation to the invasion, but the actual video shows lightning striking buildings in January. Twitter says it’s trying to combat
  this type of misleading content by monitoring and removing videos of this nature, but this goes to show how not everything we see on the internet can be trusted.

  This article discusses the prevalence of smart home tech as we progress into a digital age. The issue with
  smart home devices and appliances becoming more popular is beginning to become their lack of compatability
  with one another. This issue is soon going to be resolved with the release of matter, a language/protocol
  that allows different brands of smart home technology to communicate. Notable companies that are going to
  implement matter include Amazon, Apple, Google, Samsung, Dyson, GE, and Sonos. One issue with the release
  of matter is mass adoption is going to take some time due to the fact that not all current smart home
  devices are going to be matter compatible. Some companies have said that they may release "bridge" devices
  that will make old devices compatible with matter. Amazon has said that some Echo devices will simply need
  a firmware update but this is not necessarily the case across companies. Overall, this is an interesting
  step forward in tech as it shows that sometimes it is in big tech's best interest to work together.

* [The US is unmasking Russian hackers faster than ever](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/02/21/1046087/russian-hackers-ukraine/)

  As tensions between Russia and Ukraine continue to escalate, the world watches and waits for information about
  the conflict. On Feburary 15th and 16th, banks and government websites in Ukraine crashed after a DDos cyber attack.
  Less than 48 hours later, the United States government was able to point their fingers at Russian spies. This quick
  response is partially due to the pressing nature of the situation, as the world braces for what could be the largest
  land conflict in Eurpoe since WWII. Increasingly advanced technology and information also plays a role in the
  increased response time to the identification of cyber attackers. The article also cites politics as a reason
  that the identification has lagged in the past. Beyond this current event, the article also discusses some
  background of cyber security in the era of the internet.

* [Tech Companies’ Super Bowl Ads Leaned Into Dystopia](https://www.wired.com/story/super-bowl-ads-dystopia/)

  This article discusses the dystopian nature of some tech Super Bowl commercials, specifically
  Meta's ad for a Quest 2 game. Meta's Quest 2 ad depicted an animatronic dog that gets thrown out
  after the arcade he was a part of shut down. The dog is taken from a trash compactor and brought to
  a facility where it is given Meta's VR headset, the Quest 2. The dog then virtually returns to the arcade
  that he came from and digitally reunited with his old friends. This story, while uplifting, has some darker
  undertones because not everybody has access to VR to escape tough living conditions. The ad reminds
  us that as reality becomes bleak, the virtual world may soon be the only place for people to escape and feel
  joy. The article is not all grim as it goes on to present a few weaker dystopian examples, and counter examples of other tech
  companies airing more uplifting ads.

  AI and animal ecology experts have proposed a cross-disciplinary approach to better research wildlife species in the context of preservation. AI experts can work specifically on creating new models. On the other hand, ecologists can provide AI experts with knowledge on what attributes these said models should contain and how they relate to each other. Although a large amount of data has been collected on wildlife in the past, the models are not ideal for ecological understanding. This is because these models are not customizable, have bad quality control, and have ethical issues.

  The Identity Theft Resource Center has reported that 2021 saw the highest amount of data breaches to date. The record indicates a 68% increase from 2020’s total and a 23% increase from the previous all-time high. This is a crucial topic to address, as there is no indication that data breaches will slow down in the coming years. There is a general trend in which cybercriminals are shifting towards more focused attacks instead of massive data breaches. Following 2021’s trend, it is expected that ransomware will surpass phishing as the most likely data breach in 2022. It is encouraged that all individuals practice safe cyber practices to reduce their own risk of becoming the victim of these attacks. Interestingly, the military had no data breaches in 2021, despite an increase across all other sectors.

  Virtual Reality classes are more engaging and effective at teaching than Zoom or other video based remote learning platforms. The article first starts by describing how a professor at Stanford University used VR to teach his class and how it helped his students remain more engaged with the content. VR learning is also being implemented in Longview School for gym classes and to help students learn about war and trade through the use of games like  Civilization V. Even though headsets like the Oculus Quest 2 are becoming more affordable they are still too expensive to buy a set for a whole class in many schools. Still, students who took VR classes say they remember more from the class than video based remote classes.

  This blog article from Mozilla talks about how they have been working with Meta to create new ways for advertisers to
  get information about users in ways that still preserve the user's privacy. They are calling it 'Privacy Preserving
  Attribution' and it is supposedly a method through which advertisers can still access metrics about how effective their
  campaigns are working without getting information about specific users. This new strategy is still being worked on but
  has been submitted for approval to the various groups that govern privacy in relation to advertising. I thought this was
  particularly interesting in light of the article that I found last week, which talked about how recent privacy policies
  from Apple (allowing users to have more power over how much advertisers can learn about their behaviour) have had an impact
  on various companies' (including Meta's) profits. This seems like a possible reaction to that or at least related, in
  that companies are trying to come up with compromises that still allow advertisers to get information about users, but
  in ways that still promote privacy for the users.

* [Computer Scientists Prove Why Bigger Neural Networks Do Better](https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientists-prove-why-bigger-neural-networks-do-better-20220210/)

  A paper presented last December as a leading conference provides a new mathematical explanation for why overparameterization unexpectedly improves the performance of neural networks.
  Overparameterization is when the number of parameters is greater than the number of training samples.
  Traditionally, it was thought that one would only ever need n parameters to fit n data points (think of the number of parameters as the number of inflections in the regression).
  However, modern neural networks are routinely scaled up far beyond that predicted requirement.
  The paper shows that overparameterization is necessary for a network to be able to generalize because smoothly fitting high-dimensional data points needs n × d parameters, where d is the dimension of the input.
  Thus, this paper brings an interesting perspective to Bender and Gebru et. al.'s work questioning the "inevitability of larger LMs."
  If it is true that models being larger is necissary for their performance as this paper suggests, the social and environmental consequences of these larger models must be weighed appropriately.

* [Intel says its new crypto chip is designed to be energy-efficient](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/13/22931836/intel-new-crypto-chip-sustainability-environment)

  Intel has designed a new chip that is much more energy efficient for cryptocurrency mining as it was designed specifically to aid and
  accelerate the types of functions that blockchain technology runs on while requiring less energy. This comes at a time when the concern over
  the amount of energy that is required to mine cryptocurrency is being realized. People and givernemnts now know the huge enviomental impact
  that cryptocurreny mining has so companies are trying to come up with solutions for this. This is where intel claims that they have mage huge
  advances by desining a chip that does one thing really well, mine crypotcurrency. According to their reporting, their chip chieved "1000x
  better performance per watt than mainstream GPUs" for mining. Intel will release more information on February 23rd at the International Solid

  Intel Corporation, plans on designing a new chip that its function is solely on bitcoin mining and other cryptocurrency operations. The company expressed that later 2022 will begin selling these kinds of chips other cryptocurrencies. Even-though the decision on manufacturing these chips will be a high financial risk for the company. With cryptocurrency NFTs booming, it alters how people own and manage their digital assets. There lie fraud and theft problems, and Intel hopes to address these drawback, and extraordinarily large energy consumption behind these operation. Mining is a computationally taxing process that records transactions onto a widely shared database called the blockchain. The first miner to solve a complex computing problem is rewarded with newly minted cryptocurrency. That means there's a strong incentive to have the most powerful, the most efficient machine Evidently, Intel hopes its chip will help with the energy consumption problem which will be a huge marketing element for the consumers and environment. Because an efficiency boost may help miners cut costs and reduce power consumption that worsens global climate crisis problems and deprives others of affordable power. However, an radical improvement in the environmental impact of mining will not be expected.

  SingularityDAO recently created an AI that determined Dynasets, or selections of specific amounts of cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin or Ethereum), which performed well regardless of the instability of the crypto market. Creating this AI involved combining AI algorithms with professional hedge fund traders to maximize profits and minimize losses. Despite the market being incredibly volatile with "Bitcoin crashing around 50 percent between November 2021 and the end of January 2022", the BitCoin DynaSet (or DynaSet with BitCoin as one of the cryptocurrencies) had "10.3% better performance over just 'hodling" (holding and buying) Bitcoin". As well as, after their collaboration with Cardano to fix issues with Ethereum trading, the Ethereum DynaSet had a "12.59% better performance over just hodling Ethereum". While the project is still in beta, it's clear that with more tweaks, that the AI may be utilized for crypto asset protection in the future.

  This article from Techcrunch discusses how Google's new post-cookies approach to advertising has been approved by the UK's competition regulator. Google plans to deprecate tracking cookies for Chrome and develop a new approach to online targeted advertising; however, this move could potentially be anti-competitive as it grants Google even more dominance over online advertising, allowing them to favor their own advertisements. This approval legally binds Google into a commitment to promote competition, and the regulatory agency will be monitoring them as they propose new ad-tracking technologies.

  Investigation of this data collection was started by a letter sent by Senators Ron Wyden and Martin Heinrich to top CIA officials in April 2021.
  Documents revealed on limited information on a CIA program that collections financial information against CIA target list groups, which also
  snared some American citizen records. However, a CIA spokesperson has responded saying the CIA "recognizes and takes seriously"
  the protection and privacy of American's lives and their data in their pursuit of national security. While national security is a government duty, an ACLU lawyer reminds us that the "CIA conducts...these sweeping surveillance actitivites", which can go unnoticed by Congress
  and legislation. Such intelligence activities may require safeguards if they go unchecked.

  Neuralink, Elon Musk's company trying to develop implantable brain–machine interfaces, has begun testing
  its devices on animals, specifically monkeys. So far only 8 of the 23 monkeys have survived their
  expiraments, dying of brain hemmorages and needing to be euthanized after experiencing self-mutilation,
  skin lesions, and other debilatating health effects. Many animal rights activist groups have been critical
  of this news and the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) has filed a regulatory complaint
  against University of California, Davis, where the expiraments were being held. This forces one to consider
  the future of technological implants on animals, and even people, since Neuralink has begun hiring human
  test subjects, despite being unable to begin expiraments until the FDA gives them approval.

  Intel announced on February 11 that it would be launching a new chip targeted at blockchain applications, including
  cryptocurrency mining and the minting of NFTs. This is similar to a recent move made by Nvidia, who released a GPU
  specifically targeted at Ethereum mining. They have also formed a new group within its Accelerated Computing Systems and
  Graphics unit to further their involvement in the crypto space. Many have used environmental implications as an argument for
  why companies should not support crypto mining and similar activities; however, Intel has claimed that this new chip is more
  energy-efficient, and a result will consume significantly less power than alternative chips.

* [Apple Plane AirTag updates to curb unwanted tracking](https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/10/tech/airtag-safety-updates/index.html)

  In this article posted to CNN, it is announced that Apple is planning to make changes to their AirTag devices to improve the safety of people. With AirTags, there has been reports of people being tracked and stalked with the assistance of the Apple AirTags. Apple has been working with safety groups and some law enforcement agencies to improve the safety of people. One such way that they already improved safety protocols is an alert sent to people when it seems as if they are being tracked by an AirTag. This, however, isn't enough to prevent tracking, so Apple is implementing new changes to the AirTag systems this year including a louder tone sequence so that the device is easier to locate. Another change being added is a warning to users when setting up a new AirTag device that tracking others without their consent is a crime. Another workaround that Apple has to think about is the issue of Android users. Android users are now able to install an app that shows them any potential AirTags tracking them.

* [Scientists develop insect-sized flying robots with flapping wings](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/02/220202143053.htm)

  A university in Bristol has developed a new drive system for flapping wing autonomous
  robots, using a new method of electromechanical zipping that does away with the
  need for conventional motors and gears. This new advance could pave the way for
  smaller, lighter, and more effective micro flying robots for environmental monitoring,
  search and rescue, and deployment in hazardous environments. This takes inspiration from
  bees and other flying insects and successfully demonstrates a direct-drive artificial
  muscle system, called the Liquid-amplified Zipping Actuator (LAZA), that achieves wing motion
  using no rotating parts or gears. The LAZA system greatl simplifies the flapping mechanism
  enabling miniaturization of flapping robots down to teh size of insects.

  Apple plans to introduce updates to their AirTag product to make it harder to misuse
  them to track people. The devices have been used to track people and when when they launched,
  Apple, introduced a siftare feature that would notify people with iPhones if a suspicious AirTag
  that doesn't belong to themm, was tracking them. Now Apple is working even harder on
  preventing misuse. When users open up their AirTags for the first time, they will get a message
  that using AirTags to track people is illegal. Apple also claims that now people will
  be alerted earlier if a suspicious AirTag is tracking them. Additionally,
  users with an iPhone 11 or newer will be able to use "percision finding" to locate
  the AirTag. They can also activate the AirTag to ring to help them find it.

  established firms to find jobs in crypto and other decentralized
  tech ventures. A leading example of this is how the former CMO of
  Meta’s digital wallet project, Novi, has left the company to pursue
  a position at the blockchain-focused payments company Circle. This
  effect is similar to that of the wave of job switching in the early
  2010s that saw the arrival of companies such as Uber and Lyft.
  Whether or not this is just a trend in Silicon Valley or a lasting
  impact, only the future will know what is in store for the workers

  significantly impact Meta on top of the antitrust lawsuit under an already
  existing law from the Federal Trade Commission regarding the company’s alleged
  goal of maintain monopoly power through its acquisition of Instagram and
  WhatsApp. This call of a market cap by the senate is an attempt to control

  According to a BBC article, Amazon's Alexa told a 10-year-old girl to plug a charger into an outlet halfway,
  and then touch a penny to the exposed prongs. This incident occured while the girl and her family were
  asking Alexa for some challenges to do. The first few challenges were fun and lighthearted, but then
  Alexa said she found a challenge on the web and suggested the dangerous stunt. This apparently comes
  from a TikTok challenge, where kids would record themselves in school touching a penny to exposed prongs
  – often resulting in dangerous sparks of electricity that officials have deemed as fire hazards.
  The girl did not perform the challenge, and the mother screamed in disapproval when hearing Alexa recommend that challenge.
  Amazon has since said that they have fixed the bug.

  through ID.me because of the frustration of being verified through ID.me software.
  The facial-recognition software of video selfies with a photo ID would fail more often than succeed and users would now
  be able to verify their identity by talking to a real person instead.
  There was pushback for the long waits it took for the facial-recognition technology to work and
  how privacy advocates were against the use of facial-recognition
  because of how biometric data is kept in ID.me's database.
  Some federal agencies are questioning if their websites will continue to

  In this artical the central argument is that some software developers are using AI to help them writing code. They're discovering that AI produced codes are just as imperfect as man-made code. Reasearchers at NYU recently found that "for certain tasks where security is crucial, the code contains security flaws around 40 percent of the time." Alex Naka, a data scientist find evnethough AI may help to produce certain level of code, but it still needs human to scan through the code and fix the problem. On the other hand Hammaond Pearce, apostdocoral researcher at NYU says that "Vulnerabilities are often caused by a lack of context that a developer needs to know.” meaning that its not the AI's fault in terms of producing mistakes, it is the lack of skills of those software developers.

  This CNBC article is goes over many chip maker company's plans to increase capital spending in
  chip production. Big name companies such as TSMC and Intel have announced plans to spend $100 billion
  on production of its silicon wafers over 3 years, which mimics that of Intel's last year announcment in
  spending $20 billion on new factory plants in Arizona over 2 years. Analysts cite because of increased
  in demand in technological goods and complexity in new technology, chipmakers will increase capital expenditure
  to catch up to these new challenges. Despite these announcements, analysts cite that because of society's gluttony
  in technology goods these plans may only fullfill the "chip glut" seen once these plants and production plans are finished.
  However, with some capital response by chip makers we can hope to see the chip shortage ease, even if the road to get there is "choppy".

  long as the customer has filed with TurboTax. This article makes readers think about how
  cryptocurrency continues to permeate society - normalizing the practice of owning and trading
  cryptocurrency and increasing the accessibility of each. It is also interesting to think
  about how a digital, decentralized medium of exchange exists in conjunction to something
  as essential to our centralized government as taxes.

* [New super-conductors could take data beyond zeroes and ones](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/02/220201161056.htm)

  There is potential for encoding data in new ways due to recent research in the field of spintronics. This research, conducted by a team at Duke University and Weizmann Institute resulted in the development of a conductor system that does not require cold temperatures in order to control the spinning of electrons and sending them over long distances. This development can potentially allow large magnitude spin currents to be created at room temperature, which may change how our current devices, such as smartphones, look.

* [Meta threatens to pull Facebook and Instagram from Europe if it can't target ads](https://itwire.com/listed-tech/meta-threatens-to-pull-facebook-and-instagram-from-europe-if-it-can-t-target-ads.html)

  In July 2020, the crucial decision from the European Union Court of Justice, Schrems II, ruled the Privacy Shield as null.
  The Privacy Sheild is a US law that allowed free transfer of personal data from EU to US companies.
  There are still other legal ways to send data EU-US, but the Schrems II ruling will have large ramifications on all American companies with users in the EU in the coming years.
  Meta is retaliating by threatening to pull its products from Europe if it is not allowed to share data with its US operations, saying stopping trans-atlantic data transfers will have devastating effects on its targeted ads.
  With Meta owning apps that have billions of users, this case will be an important precedent in the ongoing clash between big tech and governments.

* [Canada’s privacy watchdog probing health officials’ use of cellphone location data](https://globalnews.ca/news/8503895/watchdog-probing-officials-cell-location-data/)

  The Public Health Agency of Canada, or PHAC, has recently come under fire after it was revealed the government agency had been buying cellphone data from telecom companies in order to track its citizens. The *Global News* article elaborates that the Canadian cellphone provider, Telus, provided the PHAC location and movement data to give government officials in order to gain a greater understanding of the efficacy of their COVID-19 policy. The PHAC has also stated its planning on utilizing the information it purchased outside of solely COVID-19 research. While the data itself was scrubbed in order to prevent the identification of individuals, many are still asking the question as if current data and privacy laws are strong enough and if there needs to be a policy precedent set for government bodies buying or utilizing data from private entities.

* [The IRS Should Stop Using Facial Recognition](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/irs-should-stop-using-facial-recognition/621386/)

  ID.me's propietary facial recognition technology is not immune to bias despite their efforts to
  market it as such. The company specifically defines their services as outside the realm of "facial
  recognition" through a narrow definition in a 2022 white paper. They explicitly define two types of facial
  recognition: one-to-one, and one-to-many facial recognition and the company asserts that
  there are "significant benefits" to using 'one-to-one' facial recognition.  However, the company fails to
  mention the racial biases of one-to-one technology that cause both false positives and false
  negatives. Despite these overwhelming issues, "27 states, multiple federal agencies, and over 500
  name brand retailers" continue to use ID.me's techology further supporting the company's false claims.

* [What Is 5G? An Electrical Engineer Explains the Technology](https://scitechdaily.com/what-is-5g-an-electrical-engineer-explains-the-technology/)

  The 5th generation of cellular networks technology is 5G and offers 10 times more bandwidth than 4G.
  The speeds of 5G can deliver from 50 megabits up to 1 GB per
  second which can download large files and stream movies very fast and easily.
  There are different band frequencies 5G can use, being that lower-frequency waves
  can extend further out, but have slower speeds and higher-frequency waves
  have the fastest speeds, but do not travel as far and cost more money which is why it is used in high concentration areas
  like stadiums and airports. Even though 5G speeds can be extremely fast,
  the more people in the area that are using 5G can carry more traffic for the bandwidth
  and cause slower connection speeds. Even though there are minor problems with 5G,
  it is still improving and has to potential to be the best cellular network technology yet.

* [Blizzard is planning a new Warcraft mobile game](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/3/22916663/activision-blizzard-warcraft-mobile-game-2022-release-date)

  is the news Blizzard is working on a new Warcraft mobile title slated for a 2022 release. According to the press release, “Blizzard is planning substantial new content for the Warcraft franchise in 2022, including [...] getting all-new mobile Warcraft content into players’ hands for the first time". The news was delivered as a press release and not a traditional call ostensibly because of its pending acquisition by Microsoft. However, I do question if the warcraft mobile is going to be elease at 2022 due to the fact that other mobile games, such as Diablo immortal and Overwatch 2 was annoced to be developed much more earlier than Warcraft Mobile. Regardless, between this sudden news of a Warcraft mobile game and the announcement of a wholly new Blizzard-developed survival game, the company is putting its best foot forward to its (pending) Microsoft overlords.

* [Nvidia ready to abandon Arm acquisition, report says](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/01/nvidia-arm-deal-is-probably-dead-report-says/)

  Ars Technica's article discusses how Nvidia's planned acquisition of the CPU-design company Arm is likely to be abandoned, since Nvidia has had trouble convincing regulators the move would not pose a risk to competition and national security. The article also states that Arm's parent company seems to be moving towards taking Arm public, seemingly implying there is not much confidence in the approval of the acquisition. Since ARM chip designs have become increasingly popular due to their power efficiency, competitors to Nvidia are concerned that their access to these designs would be limited. In addition, nation-states such as China are concerned with a key technology falling under a US company.

* [A 1-mile stretch of road is being built in Detroit that can charge electric cars as they drive -- if owners install a special receiver](https://www.businessinsider.com/public-road-detroit-to-charge-electric-cars-as-they-drive-2022-2?utm_source=reddit.com)

  Tech startup Electreon Wireless is working with Ford and DTE to build an electrified road that charges cars through inductive charging.
  Through a special receiver that costs about $3,000 to $4,000 to install, cars can be charged while driving or stopped.
  The hope is that wireless charging will aid in mass EV adoption by easing concerns related to driving range.
  Similarly, researchers at Cornell have been working on wireless charging using electric fields instead of the magnetic ones that Electreon uses, a change that might make the process cheaper and more efficient.

* [Sony is buying Bungie, the developer of Destiny and original creator of Halo](https://www.theverge.com/22910846/sony-bungie-acquisition-playstation-destiny-halo)

  This article is about the recent aquisition of games developer Bungie by Sony Interactive Entertainment for 3.6 billon dollars. This seems problematic for the playerbase of Bungies current game "Destiny 2" because Sony owning Bungie may make Destiny 2 a PlayStation exclusive game. However, Bungie says that they have an agreement to remain independant and that the game will remain multi-platform and crossplay and will not feature PlayStation exlusive content, something that has existed in Destiny 2 before. This is similar to Microsoft's aqusition of Activision Blizzard, a sign of console companies buying developers around them to support their respective platforms.

* [Sunroom is an alternative creator platform empowering women to cash in](https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/02/sunroom-creator-platform-app-women/)

  This TechCrunch article is about Sunroom, a new social media app aiming to address the
  heavy content moderation many women and non-binary content creators face on popular social
  media apps, such as Instagram by building a more open-minded platform where creators,
  only women and non-binary creators as of now, can profit off their work. As the article
  notes, Sunroom “isn’t trying to make another OnlyFans”. Instead, they hope to make a social
  media platform with limited censorship, where women and non-binary people can break down
  stigmas to profit off their creative work. The app has only 100 content creators as of its
  launch, and hopes to scale slowly to keep hands-on moderation and censorship low.

* [6 Reasons Meta Is in Trouble](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/03/technology/facebook-meta-challenges.html)

  *NY Times*'s article discusses possibilities to explain and foreshadow Meta's current and future troubles regarding the Metaverse, Facebook, and Instagram after their stock "plunged by more than 230 billion dollars". The current issues Meta faces includes hitting their user growth ceiling, changes in the data privacy from companies like Apple, and how new apps such as TikTok and Reels have affected their ways of making money off of their users. To begin with, Apple introduced an __App Tracking Transparency__ update to its operating system, "giving users the choice to ... let apps like Facebook monitor their online activities", disallowing them useful marketing data to make money off of ads, their most successful platform. Furthermore, apps such as Tiktok "present [Facebook with] a conundrum" due to the fact that to compete with Tiktok they have to focus on Reels, however while they have been very successful for bringing viewership to Instagram, they make the least amount of money per ad as users "tend to skip right past them". These newfound opponents of ad-space, users, and data privacy, along with Facebook's questionable funding of the Metaverse, have placed a dark cloud over Meta, scaring potential investors away leading to their stock plummet.

* [Apple Privacy Update Impact on Profits of other Companies](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/03/technology/apple-privacy-changes-meta.html)

  This article talks about the effect that Apple's new privacy policies have had on
  the profits of various social media companies. The new policies regard user's
  abilities to choose the extent to which advertisers can track them, and services
  such as Meta, Snap, Twitter, and others have expressed displeasure with these
  policies and have since experienced lower stock prices as a result. This is an
  interesting article because it emphasizes the conflict between ethics and profits
  in the technology industry. It also shows that Apple has an incredible amount of
  power over many other big technological services.

* [Sony Buys Bungie for $3.6 Billion](https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-sony-buys-bungie)

  Sony recently announced that it would be acquiring Bungie, the original developers of Halo and
  current developers of Destiny 2, for 3.6 billion dollars, with 1.2 billion being paid to the studio's
  employees. It is theorized that this 1.2 billion is intended to keep developers from leaving at this
  time. Some also have speculated that this is in response to Microsoft's recent announcement
  that they intend to acquire Activision Blizzard. However, that would not necessarily make sense,
  as the purchase of such a large game studio as Bungie would take more than a couple of weeks,
  and there is certainly more incentive for Sony to purchase a multi-platform game studio.
  Nevertheless, it could also be in response to other huge acquisitions by Microsoft, including that
  of Zenimax Media Inc., the parent company of Bethesda.

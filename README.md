* [Search histories, location data, text messages: How personal data could be used to enforce anti-abortion laws](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/05/tech/abortion-laws-phone-privacy/index.html)

A recent movement among Republican controlled states has many privacy and women's rights activists worried. States that restrict and criminalize abortion have begun a spree of legislation that takes aim at the personal data of those seeking abortions. There has been an increase in privacy concerns as states like Texas or Oklahoma could subpoena various apps as evidence of seeking or planning to get an abortion. Notable apps include those that track your period or your pregnancy could be classified as evidence and presented in front of a court. Because of the wording of the state legislation, abortion-seeking conduct is criminalized. Therefore even seeking resources or information on how to access an abortion would be illegal. This could extend further than data found within apps, as law-enforcement officials could seek to acquire geo-location data from companies like Google in order to approximate an individual's location at a certain time. This sets an extremely dangerous precedent both for privacy regulation and for the rights of women. Criminalizing the act of getting information and using something like the apps they use to do it is mind-boggling.

* [Google Chrome restricts access to patched 0-day exploit](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2022/03/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_25.html)

If you browse the Stable-channels for the various pieces of software you use you've probably seen a page that alerts you of the various CVE's that have been patched in the latest release notes. These normally include an identifying number, the person who reported it, a brief explanation of what it was, and a link to the initial bug report. However, all the way back in March, Chrome patched CVE-2022-1096. Instead of the usual fanfair listed earlier, they didn't actually disclose the vulnerability for how dangerous it could actually be. This is only done in extremely rare circumstances, when a vulnerability could have a high impact on the browser's ecosystem. While this really isn't all that exciting, after all it's been patched, it is important to keep in mind that the Chrome web browser is actually the basis for a massive portion of software outside of the web browser. The Chromium Engine powers several browsers, the NodeJS environment, and plenty of other pieces of software. I guess this is a reminder to always keep your software up to date.

* [The Fragile Open Source Ecosystem Isn’t Ready for ‘Protestware’](https://www.wired.com/story/open-source-sabotage-protestware/)

Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent shockwaves across the globe. Now it seems these shockwaves are beginning to make their way into open source software. Over the past week those maintaining such open source code bases have begun to find a series of deliberate attempts at sabotage. These attempts at sabotage are targeted specifically at Russian machines as a means to support Ukrainian war efforts. Open source projects have been embedded with various forms of malware, from data wipers to ransomware attacks. This proves troubling to an already shaky space as many open source projects are severely underfunded or understaffed, often times both. This can mean the vandalized could can go unnoticed. This not only sets a dangerous precedent for software to take a political stance, but it also severely undermines public opinion and faith in the open source ecosystem.

As is the case with all things Apple, their newest M1 chips are in a walled garden. Although Apple's newest processor is just about to turn 2, it still boasts some of the most impressive benchmarks when compared to other high-end consumer processors. This performance is made all the more sour by the fact that these processors can't support x86 based software. This means Windows and Linux can't run on these machines, unless using some tricky workaround like parallels or another emulator. This however has changed thanks to the release of Asahi Linux. Asahi Linux is the newest distro that seeks to natively run a Linux distribution on the bare metal of an M1 Macbook. Just lask week they released one of their first alpha's with dozens of working features. Although much is still left to be done with a lot of features on the to-do list, what's here is absolutely promising.

A new week, a new union vote for Amazon employees. Last April Amazon was victorious when its employees at the Bessemer Alabama fulfillment voted to not unionize. This victory however seems to be short lived after the National Labor Relations board voted to allow a second vote after allegations surfaced that Amazon engaged in illegal action when attempting to convince employees not to unionize. While voting has already begun, in fact it began almost a month ago on February 4th. Tallying will began on March 28th, to reveal if Amazon will have another victory or union's will finally get a much needed win. All of this occurs as various retail stores and companies across the country began to unionize. Starbucks, REI, and Amazon are among the few of many large corporate chains who have been facing its employees' vote to unionize.

    
* [Netflix buys independent game developer Boss Fight in latest gaming acquisition](https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/25/netflix-buys-game-developer-boss-fight/)

Netflix has been making several big time acquisitions in the gaming space. Their most recent acquisition involves indie game developer 'Boss Fight Entertainment'. This has been one of many recent talent acquisitions made on behalf of Netflix. All of this comes along with Netflix's recent moves into the gaming, as they began to offer games to users with their subscription. Boss Fight Entertainment is the third acquisition this year, as Netflix also picked up Finland's Next Games for 72 million and Night School studio for an undisclosed amount. Netflix is  trying to offer games as a part of its extensive video catalog and is willing to spend the cash to make it happen. If it all pans out however, still remains to be seen.


* [Texas Sues Meta Over Facebook’s Facial-Recognition Practices](https://www.wsj.com/articles/texas-sues-meta-over-facebooks-facial-recognition-practices-11644854794)

The Texas attorney general has now filed a suit against Meta Platforms alleging that Facebook violated privacy law within the state for the way it handled biometrics. The biometrics and facial recognition cited in the lawsuit was scrapped back in November of 2021, however, Texas AG Ken Paxton stated that for over a decade the existence of facial geometric data within Facebook's platform has resulted in the violation of Texas law. Within the lawsuit Mr. Paxton stated that "Facebook has been secretly harvesting Texans' personal information... for its own corporate profit" and that to do so without informed consent is illegal. Within the Texas law a single privacy infraction draws a $25,000 fine, over the course of the decade Facebook has broken that law millions of times, meaning Texas officials are asking for hundreds of billions of dollars in restitution. It should also be noted that this lawsuit has come about after Facebook settled with the state of Illinois for their class-action lawsuit regarding similar grievances with Facebook's facial recognition and data collection practices.

The Public Health Agency of Canada, or PHAC, has recently come under fire after it was revealed the government agency had been buying cellphone data from telecom companies in order to track its citizens. The *Global News* article elaborates that the Canadian cellphone provider, Telus, provided the PHAC location and movement data to give government officials in order to gain a greater understanding of the efficacy of their COVID-19 policy. The PHAC has also stated its planning on utilizing the information it purchased outside of solely COVID-19 research. While the data itself was scrubbed in order to prevent the identification of individuals, many are still asking the question as if current data and privacy laws are strong enough and if there needs to be a policy precedent set for government bodies buying or utilizing data from private entities.

* [Nintendo hacker Gary Bowser sentenced to 3 years in prison](https://www.pcgamer.com/nintendo-hacker-gary-bowser-sentenced-to-3-years-in-prison/)

Gary Bowser, a Canadian national who had been extradited to the United States from the Dominican Republic, has been sentenced to 3 years in prison and ordered to pay a fine totalling $4.5 million to Nintendo of America. Bowser had previously pled guilty to the federal charges of Conspiracy to Circumvent Technological Measures and to Traffic in Circumvention Devices, and Trafficking in Circumvention Devices back in October 2021. Bowser was the main man behind a team of hackers known as 'Team Xecuter' who were known for their Nintendo Switch homebrew and jailbreaking software. During the trial Nintendo alleged that Bowser "caused more than $65 million in losses to videogame companies, but the damage goes beyond these businesses, harming videogame developers and the small, creative studios whose products and hard work is essentially stolen when games are pirated". While Nintendo getting angry at software modders isn't new, the Federal Government getting involved and handing out hefty finds and jailtime certainly is. Bowser's sentencing has many wondering if this represents a era of piracy prevention on the part of the US government.

* [The IRS Should Stop Using Facial Recognition](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/irs-should-stop-using-facial-recognition/621386/)

ID.me's propietary facial recognition technology is not immune to bias despite their efforts to
market it as such. The company specifically defines their services as outside the realm of "facial
recognition" through a narrow definition in a 2022 white paper. They explicitly define two types of facial
recognition: one-to-one, and one-to-many facial recognition and the company asserts that
there are "significant benefits" to using 'one-to-one' facial recognition.  However, the company fails to
mention the racial biases of one-to-one technology that cause both false positives and false
negatives. Despite these overwhelming issues, "27 states, multiple federal agencies, and over 500
name brand retailers" continue to use ID.me's techology further supporting the company's false claims.

* [What Is 5G? An Electrical Engineer Explains the Technology](https://scitechdaily.com/what-is-5g-an-electrical-engineer-explains-the-technology/)

The 5th generation of cellular networks technology is 5G and offers 10 times more bandwidth than 4G.
The speeds of 5G can deliver from 50 megabits up to 1 GB per
second which can download large files and stream movies very fast and easily.
There are different band frequencies 5G can use, being that lower-frequency waves
can extend further out, but have slower speeds and higher-frequency waves
have the fastest speeds, but do not travel as far and cost more money which is why it is used in high concentration areas
like stadiums and airports. Even though 5G speeds can be extremely fast,
the more people in the area that are using 5G can carry more traffic for the bandwidth
and cause slower connection speeds. Even though there are minor problems with 5G,
it is still improving and has to potential to be the best cellular network technology yet.

* [Blizzard is planning a new Warcraft mobile game](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/3/22916663/activision-blizzard-warcraft-mobile-game-2022-release-date)

is the news Blizzard is working on a new Warcraft mobile title slated for a 2022 release. According to the press release, “Blizzard is planning substantial new content for the Warcraft franchise in 2022, including [...] getting all-new mobile Warcraft content into players’ hands for the first time". The news was delivered as a press release and not a traditional call ostensibly because of its pending acquisition by Microsoft. However, I do question if the warcraft mobile is going to be elease at 2022 due to the fact that other mobile games, such as Diablo immortal and Overwatch 2 was annoced to be developed much more earlier than Warcraft Mobile. Regardless, between this sudden news of a Warcraft mobile game and the announcement of a wholly new Blizzard-developed survival game, the company is putting its best foot forward to its (pending) Microsoft overlords.

* [Nvidia ready to abandon Arm acquisition, report says](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/01/nvidia-arm-deal-is-probably-dead-report-says/)

Ars Technica's article discusses how Nvidia's planned acquisition of the CPU-design company Arm is likely to be abandoned, since Nvidia has had trouble convincing regulators the move would not pose a risk to competition and national security. The article also states that Arm's parent company seems to be moving towards taking Arm public, seemingly implying there is not much confidence in the approval of the acquisition. Since ARM chip designs have become increasingly popular due to their power efficiency, competitors to Nvidia are concerned that their access to these designs would be limited. In addition, nation-states such as China are concerned with a key technology falling under a US company.

* [A 1-mile stretch of road is being built in Detroit that can charge electric cars as they drive -- if owners install a special receiver](https://www.businessinsider.com/public-road-detroit-to-charge-electric-cars-as-they-drive-2022-2?utm_source=reddit.com)

Tech startup Electreon Wireless is working with Ford and DTE to build an electrified road that charges cars through inductive charging.
Through a special receiver that costs about $3,000 to $4,000 to install, cars can be charged while driving or stopped.
The hope is that wireless charging will aid in mass EV adoption by easing concerns related to driving range.
Similarly, researchers at Cornell have been working on wireless charging using electric fields instead of the magnetic ones that Electreon uses, a change that might make the process cheaper and more efficient.

* [Sony is buying Bungie, the developer of Destiny and original creator of Halo](https://www.theverge.com/22910846/sony-bungie-acquisition-playstation-destiny-halo)

This article is about the recent aquisition of games developer Bungie by Sony Interactive Entertainment for 3.6 billon dollars. This seems problematic for the playerbase of Bungies current game "Destiny 2" because Sony owning Bungie may make Destiny 2 a PlayStation exclusive game. However, Bungie says that they have an agreement to remain independant and that the game will remain multi-platform and crossplay and will not feature PlayStation exlusive content, something that has existed in Destiny 2 before. This is similar to Microsoft's aqusition of Activision Blizzard, a sign of console companies buying developers around them to support their respective platforms.

* [Sunroom is an alternative creator platform empowering women to cash in](https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/02/sunroom-creator-platform-app-women/)

This TechCrunch article is about Sunroom, a new social media app aiming to address the
heavy content moderation many women and non-binary content creators face on popular social
media apps, such as Instagram by building a more open-minded platform where creators,
only women and non-binary creators as of now, can profit off their work. As the article
notes, Sunroom “isn’t trying to make another OnlyFans”. Instead, they hope to make a social
media platform with limited censorship, where women and non-binary people can break down
stigmas to profit off their creative work. The app has only 100 content creators as of its
launch, and hopes to scale slowly to keep hands-on moderation and censorship low.

* [6 Reasons Meta Is in Trouble](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/03/technology/facebook-meta-challenges.html)

*NY Times*'s article discusses possibilities to explain and foreshadow Meta's current and future troubles regarding the Metaverse, Facebook, and Instagram after their stock "plunged by more than 230 billion dollars". The current issues Meta faces includes hitting their user growth ceiling, changes in the data privacy from companies like Apple, and how new apps such as TikTok and Reels have affected their ways of making money off of their users. To begin with, Apple introduced an __App Tracking Transparency__ update to its operating system, "giving users the choice to ... let apps like Facebook monitor their online activities", disallowing them useful marketing data to make money off of ads, their most successful platform. Furthermore, apps such as Tiktok "present [Facebook with] a conundrum" due to the fact that to compete with Tiktok they have to focus on Reels, however while they have been very successful for bringing viewership to Instagram, they make the least amount of money per ad as users "tend to skip right past them". These newfound opponents of ad-space, users, and data privacy, along with Facebook's questionable funding of the Metaverse, have placed a dark cloud over Meta, scaring potential investors away leading to their stock plummet.

* [Apple Privacy Update Impact on Profits of other Companies](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/03/technology/apple-privacy-changes-meta.html)

This article talks about the effect that Apple's new privacy policies have had on
the profits of various social media companies. The new policies regard user's
abilities to choose the extent to which advertisers can track them, and services
such as Meta, Snap, Twitter, and others have expressed displeasure with these
policies and have since experienced lower stock prices as a result. This is an
interesting article because it emphasizes the conflict between ethics and profits
in the technology industry. It also shows that Apple has an incredible amount of
power over many other big technological services.

* [Sony Buys Bungie for $3.6 Billion](https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-sony-buys-bungie)

Sony recently announced that it would be acquiring Bungie, the original developers of Halo and
current developers of Destiny 2, for 3.6 billion dollars, with 1.2 billion being paid to the studio's
employees. It is theorized that this 1.2 billion is intended to keep developers from leaving at this
time. Some also have speculated that this is in response to Microsoft's recent announcement
that they intend to acquire Activision Blizzard. However, that would not necessarily make sense,
as the purchase of such a large game studio as Bungie would take more than a couple of weeks,
and there is certainly more incentive for Sony to purchase a multi-platform game studio.
Nevertheless, it could also be in response to other huge acquisitions by Microsoft, including that
of Zenimax Media Inc., the parent company of Bethesda.

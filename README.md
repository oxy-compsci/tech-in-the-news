  Computer scientists have created virtual eyes that precisely imitate how humans see the world, allowing businesses to train virtual reality and augmented reality systems also known as EyeSyn In May 2022, the findings will be presented at the International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN). Eye movement data is priceless for organizations developing metaverse platforms and applications. By reading the user's eyes, developers can adjust material to their engagement reactions or decrease the resolution in their peripheral vision to conserve processing resources. For instance, while someone is listening to someone speak, their gaze alternates between the speaker's eyes, nose, and mouth for varying lengths of time. The researchers developed a model to determine the location of those elements on a speaker and designed their virtual eyes to simulate time spent focusing on them.

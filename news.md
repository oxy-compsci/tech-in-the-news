* [Uber Close to Deal for Partnership With San Francisco Taxi Outfit](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/28/technology/uber-taxis-san-francisco-deal.html/)

Uber is close to completing an agreement with a San Francisco partner Flywheel Technologies and the partnership would allow Uber passengers to call a taxi through the Uber app. 
If this agreement is approved by SF Municipal Transportation Agencyâ€™s board of directors, Uber's upfront cost would not need to be the same as a traditional meter-based service. 
The program pursues to help taxi drivers earn more money by countering meter anxiety which the ride based companies have combated because they made a set price of the person's trip before going on the ride.
Despite this deal, Taxi drivers are not happy because they are not going to get paid a per-ride fare which helps them make a decent living wage.
Taxi drivers deel like people are conditioned to order Ubers because of the tought that it is a cheaper option.

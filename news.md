* [Super Bowl ads boosted crypto app downloads by 279%, led by Coinbase](https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/17/super-bowl-ads-boosted-crypto-app-downloads-by-279-led-by-coinbase/)

Sensor Tower revealed that Tech companies' Super Bowl ads majorly boosted app downloads/installs
in the US with Coinbase having the best results.
Coinbase's installs jumped 309% week-over-week after the ad aired when their ad was a QR code 
bouncing around on the screen like the DVD logo. 
eToro and FTX had increased downloads with eToro app installs increasing
by 132% week-over-week and FTX app installs receiving a 
130% boost week-over-week in downloads. Even with this huge increase in downloads, some apps did not benefit as much
like the Oculus app moving down in the US App store ranks from #102 to #175 on Monday. 
Despite some ads not working out as intended, the Super Bowl ads still boosted
installs for other apps like YouTube TV, Disney+, HBO MAX, and DraftKings 
which saw a jump up in US App store ranks.
